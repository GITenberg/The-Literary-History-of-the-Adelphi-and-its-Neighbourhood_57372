<p>This book is intended for the general reader, as well as for the
antiquarian and the lover of London. To this end, the history of the
Adelphi and its immediate neighbourhood to the west and on the south
side of the Strand has been related in&mdash;as far as possible&mdash;narrative
form. At the same time, it need hardly be said, every care has been
taken to present the multitude of details correctly and as a truthful
picture of one of the most interesting parts of the great metropolis.
I should be ungrateful if I did not take this opportunity of again&mdash;as
in the case of my chronicle of the Lyceum and Henry Irving&mdash;thanking
Mr. E. Gardner for so courteously placing at my disposal his unique and
invaluable collection of London records and engravings. The majority
of the illustrations were kindly lent by him; others were copied from
prints in the British Museum. I have also to thank the officials of St.
Martin's Library for their ready help in enabling me to consult, at my
leisure, some scarce books connected with the literature of historical
London.</p>

<p class="ph2">INTRODUCTION</p>


<p>"The Literary History of the Adelphi" has journeyed from one side of
the neighbourhood to the other, from west to east. That is to say, its
publication has been acquired by Mr. Fisher Unwin, hence the removal
of the book from York Buildings to Adelphi&mdash;originally called "Royal,"
and still so marked on the old plans&mdash;Terrace. This peregrination
gives me the opportunity of supplementing the original work with some
interesting particulars which have just come into my possession.
Who would think that within a short distance of the Strand, if not
actually within the proverbial stone's throw, there are "cottages," and
cottages, too, with trees and flowers and lawns, and a mighty river,
for prospect? Yet such is the case, although it is no wonder that the
rate collector who is new to this part of London has much ado to find
"Adelphi cottages." They belong to that mysterious region which lies
underneath the Strand level of the Adelphi and is vaguely known as the
"arches." If the reader will glance at the illustration which faces
page 32&mdash;"The Buildings called the Adelphi"&mdash;he will see, at the top of
the arches and under the terrace, some fifteen semi-circular recesses.
These are really capacious rooms, and from the windows thereof the view
of the Embankment Gardens and the Thames is considerable compensation
for the tediousness and deviousness of the approach. The "cottages"
were originally attached to the houses on the terrace above, and, until
recent years, they were inhabited. Now, however, the majority of them
are let separately and are used as stores or workshops. One of them,
however, is still occupied as a dwelling-place, and, whatever else it
may be, this habitation is certainly unique.</p>

<p>Underneath the "Adelphi cottages," and extending below the houses of
the terrace, and John, Robert, and Adam Streets, are the famous arches,
which few people, either Londoners, who know nothing of their own city,
or Americans, who are versed in the lore of our ancient streets, have
ever visited. Truth to tell, the expedition to the Adelphi arches is
not to be undertaken with too light a heart. The gloomy recesses do not
conduce to joy, and, although the foot-pad has scant opportunity for
indulging in his nefarious practices, he would be a venturesome person,
a stranger to these parts, who would wander alone in this underground
world after the sun, which never enters these passages, had ceased to
illumine the earth above. This very darkness and dismalness has its
advantages at times. When Messrs. Coutts, for instance, moved from
their old premises in the Strand, there was much speculation as to the
manner in which they transferred their immense stock of securities,
deeds, and other valuables from one side of the road to the other.
There was great talk at the time of armies of detectives and the use of
the early hours of Sundays, and other vague suggestions were allowed to
be promulgated. It was assumed that the transference would take place
from one side of the road to the other, and it was thought that there
might be some audacious attempts at robbery. In reality, the matter was
quite simple and there was not the slightest danger of any attack upon
the priceless possessions. Far removed from the noisy Strand&mdash;in regard
to atmosphere and surroundings&mdash;there is an arch, dark indeed, and shut
off from the outer world by huge gates, which are some distance away.
Here, many feet below the surface of the streets, is a secret entrance
to the premises of the old bank. And here, in absolute security, never
dreamt of by the enterprising thief, the carts were loaded with their
treasures.</p>

<p>The actual removal of these valuables was effected with great ease. The
carts wended their innocent way through the dreary arches, in front of
the "cottages," and passed out by a "right of way" underneath the Hotel
Cecil, towards Blackfriars. Thus, the would-be thief was deluded of his
prey. This "right of way" marks the bottom of Ivy Lane, which is still
in existence. It runs from the Strand and denotes the boundary of the
Duchy of Lancaster and the City of Westminster. Formerly, it was an
open thoroughfare, but there is now, at the Strand entrance as well as
at the bottom, a gate. At the river end, there was, in olden times, a
bridge, or pier, called Ivy Bridge. But I think that there must have
been, not only a bridge in the Strand, but that there was a stream
which ran hence into the Thames. John Stow, in his "Survey of London,"
first published in 1598, speaks of "Ivy Bridge, in the High Street,
which had a way under it leading to the Thames, the like as sometime
had the Strand Bridge." Now, the Strand Bridge was over the stream of
St. Clement's Well, and Strand Lane, like Ivy Lane, ran down to the
river, and, like it, there was a pier at the end. I am the more certain
that there must have been a river of sorts at the junction of Ivy Lane
and the Strand, because to this day, as I found in the course of a
recent investigation, a stream trickles under John Street and renders
useless a large cellar. Nothing can stop it. It percolates now, just
as it has done ever since the excavations made by the Brothers Adam in
1768. It is drained away, but it is just sufficient to create a damp
atmosphere which is detrimental to the storing of wine.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of bottles of wine&mdash;chiefly port, claret, and
burgundy&mdash;are in bins here, and a most admirable place for the purpose
it is. The underground Adelphi is absolutely dry&mdash;save for the one
spot mentioned&mdash;and the temperature does not vary five degrees in the
course of a year. Here, also, are many hundreds of cases of champagne,
and here the jaded Londoner&mdash;if he be sufficiently favoured&mdash;might come
and feast his eyes on some few dozens of bottles of "white port"&mdash;a
wine which is not in fashion in these degenerate days, but which, I
rejoiced to learn, is still sent hence to a certain royal household.
Strange as it may seem, there is a strong air of royalty about these
dimly-lit vaults. What between the secret entrance to the old premises
of the great bankers&mdash;Messrs. Coutts are the bankers for his Majesty
and for the Queen<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;and the "white port" which gives its benefit
to illustrious persons of royal lineage, there is a distinct feeling
that one is moving on an exalted plane when, paradoxical as it may
seem, we are in this subterranean place. The distinctly regal air
which pervades these caves of silence may have given rise to a certain
statement that hereabouts&mdash;half a dozen yards from the royal stock of
"white port"&mdash;Lady Jane Grey was cast into a dungeon deep and carried
thence to the dreaded Tower, there to be beheaded. But the "Nine Days'
Queen" knew only her gardens and her flowers when she lived in Durham
House&mdash;the predecessor of the Adelphi. Here, in May, 1553, the Duke of
Northumberland married his son, Lord Guildford Dudley, to Lady Jane,
in pursuance of his design for altering the succession from the Tudor
to the Dudley family. The unfortunate girl of scarce seventeen summers
certainly left Durham House for the Tower&mdash;but it was with great pomp
and circumstance, in order to be proclaimed Queen. Her execution
followed hard upon, but she knew not imprisonment in what is now the
Adelphi. On the other hand, the haunt of a wretched woman is still to
be seen in this gloomy spot. "Jenny's Holes" figure on the plan to this
day, and are not likely to be obliterated therefrom. Into one or other
of these places&mdash;recesses by the main arches&mdash;the outcast came to sleep
and, finally, to die; some say, indeed, that she was murdered here.
"Jenny" has no history, but the vague tradition of her misery still
haunts these "dark arches." Nor is the story at all improbable. The
"dark arches" are forbidding enough now, and, even in the day-time, the
sparse gas jets only serve to make darkness visible. So recently as the
early seventies, when Mr. George Drummond came into the property, cows
were kept in the underground passages of the Adelphi.</p>

<p>Adelphi Terrace, Adam Street to the east, and John Street, which is
parallel with the terrace and the Strand, and in between, still retain
much of their old-world appearance. But at the western side of the
Adelphi changes are afoot. There is a new building, facing the river,
but stunted and barred from its proper height by that bugbear of the
modern builder, "ancient lights." Then, again, the Caledonian Hotel,
in Robert Street, has taken to itself a new storey, and has been
transmogrified into modern flats with&mdash;oh, shade of Adam!&mdash;bath-rooms.
The searcher after the picturesque in London architecture might do
worse than descend from the Strand, past the Tivoli. He will then be on
the site of one of the gateways of Old Durham House, and, turning to
the right, he will see a bridge of beautiful design. It was built, in
order to connect the Strand and Adelphi premises of the bank, by Thomas
Coutts, who procured a special Act of Parliament for the purpose.</p>

<p>The entire Adelphi estate occupies a little over three acres and a
quarter, divided as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The names of two more noted inhabitants of the Adelphi have to be
included in this "History." The learned Vicesimus Knox (1752-1821), who
is best known to fame as the compiler of "Elegant Extracts" (1789),
lived at No. 1, Adam Street. The first floor of the same house was
the place of retirement, for a score of years, of George Blamire,
barrister-at-law, "of very eccentric habits, but sound mind." John
Timbs, in his "Curiosities of London," states that "no person was
allowed to enter his chamber, his meals and all communications being
left by his housekeeper at the door of his ante-room. He was found dead
in an arm-chair, in which he had been accustomed to sleep for twenty
years. He died of exhaustion, from low fever and neglect; at which time
his rooms were filled with furniture, books, plate, paintings, and
other valuable property." The eccentric habits are evident; but the
"sound mind" is a little doubtful.</p>

<p>Finally, I may state that I have followed the fortunes of my book,
and, after a brief excursion into the noisy part of the world on the
other side of Charing Cross, have returned to the quiet and comparative
solitude of the Adelphi, where tubes do not trouble and motor buses do
not annoy. "Sir," said Dr. Johnson, "when a man is tired of London, he
is tired of life." And I think that there is no part of London of which
a man can be in less apprehension of tiring than the Adelphi. It is of
London, yet away from it; in the heart of the world, yet secluded. To
know it is to love it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is my pleasant duty to relate in these pages the romantic
story of kings and queens, of prelates and princes, of book-writers
and book-sellers, of artists, architects, and actors, and of other
players on life's fitful stage who, for six centuries and a half, have
contributed to one of the most interesting chapters in the history of
London. Within that small space which has been known as the Adelphi
since 1772, a district so confined that it is contained within five
hundred square yards, came, in its earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> years, several bishops and
other clerical dignitaries, then that prince who was afterwards the
fifth King Henry of England, anon, amid much pomp and pageantry, King
Henry VIII. Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth were familiar with it, and
here lived, for twenty years, Sir Walter Raleigh, who inhabited one
of the towers which is seen in Hollar's engraving of Durham House.
Lady Jane Grey went hence to the Tower and thence to the scaffold.
Dryden alluded to it in one of his plays. Voltaire drank wine here,
and its memory is hallowed by Dr Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Sir Joshua
Reynolds, and a host of other celebrities. Here David Garrick began his
career, and here, curiously enough, he ended it, the funeral procession
of the "poor player" reaching from the Adelphi to Westminster Abbey,
those who followed him to the grave numbering many men of rank and
genius, including Johnson, and a large concourse of the general public
who grieved for the loss of the great actor.</p>

<p>The history of the world-famous banking firm of Coutts &amp; Co. is
indelibly associated with the Adelphi. Dickens, when a boy, prowled
about its dark arches&mdash;until lately, one of the most degraded spots in
London&mdash;and last, though not least, the brothers Adam, to whom London
owes several architectural triumphs, in addition to the Adelphi, claim
our attention. It is said that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> a public dinner, at the beginning
of the last century, a worthy alderman whose knowledge of Greek was
very vague, was much struck by the toast, in reference to two royal
brothers&mdash;George IV. and the Duke of York&mdash;of "the Adelphi."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> When it
came to the alderman's turn to speak, he said that, as they were on the
subject of streets, he would "beg leave to propose 'Finsbury Square.'"
In somewhat similar manner, before we get to the Adelphi, we must go
back to its origin, and this takes us to the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Durham House, which, with its grounds, formerly occupied the entire
site of the Adelphi, was the town residence of Anthony Bek (otherwise
Anthony de Beck or Bec), Bishop of Durham in the reign of Edward I.
So it is affirmed by Pennant, and there is no reason to doubt the
assertion. Some mistakes have arisen on this point, in consequence,
as it appears to me, of there having been two men of the same name,
both of whom were bishops. Their ancestor, Walter Bek, came to England
with William the Conqueror, and from his three sons sprang three
great Lincolnshire families: Bek of Eresby, Bek of Luceby, and Bek of
Botheby. Now, Bishop Antony Bek the second (1279-1343), son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> Walter
Bek of Luceby, constable of Lincoln Castle, was at one time Bishop
of Lincoln, and, in 1337, Bishop of Norwich. But Antony Bek, son of
Walter Bek, baron of Eresby, was appointed to the see of Durham in
1283. He was intimately associated with Edward I., being one of his
chief advisers during the negotiations regarding Baliol, and of great
assistance to him in his Scottish expeditions of 1296 and 1298. Owing
to a dispute with the prior of the convent of Durham, he was deprived
of certain of his rights by the king (but regained them on application
to the Pope). As this, however, occurred in the year 1300, it may
safely be assumed that Antony Bek had occupied Durham House before that
event.</p>

<p>But there was a Durham House even earlier than this of Antony Bek's,
if we are to credit an account given by Thomas Fuller. Here, in 1238,
the papal legate, Otho, was staying, and hither he summoned the English
bishops in order to debate as to what "further steps should be taken
respecting the churches and schools of Oxford, which he had laid
under interdict on account of the scholars having, when the legate
was staying at Oseney, killed his brother and clerk of the kitchen in
an affray,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the legate himself being obliged to fly from the city.
At the intercession of the bishops, the legate assented to pardon
the university on con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>dition of the clergy and scholars making their
"solemn submission" to him. As a result, the offenders "went from St
Paul's in London to Durham House in the Strand, no short Italian, but
an English long, mile, all on foot; the bishops of England, for the
more state of the business, accompanying them, as partly accessory to
their fault, for pleading on their behalf. When they came to the Bishop
of Carlisle's house, the scholars went the rest of the way barefoot,
<i>sine capis et mantulis</i>, which some understand, 'without capes or
cloaks.' And thus the great legate at last was really reconciled to
them."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Some of these old chronicles are not always to be relied upon in the
matter of dates: "This howse called Durham, or Dunelme Howse, was
buylded in the time of Henry 3, by one Antonye Becke, B. of Durham. It
is a howse of 300 years antiquitie; the hall whereof is statelie and
high, supported with lofty marble pillars. It standeth on the Thamise
veriye pleasantlie." So wrote one historian in 1593. But Henry III.
died in 1272, eleven years before Bek was made Bishop of Durham. That
there was a Durham House of sorts before Bek's time is pretty certain,
although it was not the one that is attributed to that bishop. The
story has often been told of Henry III., in 1258, being caught in a
thunderstorm on his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> down the Thames on his barge. At that time,
the Earl of Leicester was the head of the barons who were opposed to
the king, and it is said that he was then in occupation of Durham
House (we have already seen that the papal legate was installed there
twenty years earlier). Be this as it may, the king sought shelter from
the storm, and, as the royal barge approached the shore, the Earl of
Leicester went forth and endeavoured to allay any fears that the king
might have felt, saying, "Your Majesty need not be afraid, for the
tempest is nearly over." But the king, being moved to wrath, fiercely
exclaimed, "Above measure, I dread thunder and lightning, but, by the
head of God, I am more in terror of thee than of all the thunder and
lightning in the world." Though this story may be doubted, one early
royal memory of Durham House is that of Prince Henry (Henry V.), who,
in 1411, "lay at the bysshoppes inne of Darham for the seid day of
his comming to towne unto the Moneday nest after the feste of Septem
fratum."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>That most correct of London historians, John Stow, sets down the
fourteenth century as the date of Durham House. "On the south side of
which street" (meaning the Strand, which had no name in Stow's time),
he says, "in the liberties of Westminster (beginning at Ivy Bridge),
first is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> Durham House, built by Thomas Hatfield, Bishop of Durham, who
was made bishop of that see in 1345, and sat bishop there thirty-six
years." But we have already seen from Fuller, whose <i>Church History of
Britain</i>&mdash;from which the quotation in regard to the papal legate, Otho,
is taken&mdash;was written in 1655, fifty years after Stow's death, that
there was a Durham House in 1238.</p>

<p>And this brings me to a curious point. Thomas Pennant, whose <i>Account
of London</i> affords much entertaining reading, has an amusing
disquisition on the word "palace." He writes: "That the word is only
applicable to the habitations of princes, or princely persons, and
that it is with all the impropriety of vanity bestowed on the houses
of those who have luckily acquired money enough to pile on one another
a greater quantity of stones and bricks than their neighbours. How
many imaginary <i>Parks</i> have been formed within precincts where deer
were never seen! and how many houses misnamed <i>Halls</i> which never had
attached to them the privilege of a manor!" Leigh Hunt took the "lively
Pennant," as he dubs him, to task on this point: "Unless the words
<i>palazzo</i> and <i>piazza</i> are traceable to the same root, <i>palatium</i> (as
perhaps they are), place does not of necessity mean palace; and palace
certainly does not mean exclusively the habitation of princes and
princely persons (that is to say, supposing princeliness to exclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
riches), for in Italy, whence it comes, any large mansion may be called
a palace; and many old palaces there were built by merchants."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But
the disquisition does not really alter the fact that the proper name,
that is to say, the original one, should be Durham House; we have the
excellent authority of Stow and Fuller on this head. The residences in
London of the bishops were almost invariably called "House"&mdash;certainly
not "palace." Thus, Worcester House, which is now marked by the Savoy,
originally belonged to the see of Carlisle, and is "the Bishop of
Carlisle's House" which is alluded to in the extract from Fuller. York
House, which stood to the west of Durham House, was originally the town
inn or residence of the Bishop of Norwich, and, subsequently, in Queen
Mary's reign, of Heath, Archbishop of York. In the Aggas map of London
in 1563, which is the frontispiece to Pennant's "Account," Duresme
Place and York Place are given, but that the name in its earlier years
was Durham House there is no doubt. The London County Council has
lately (1906) perpetuated the name by changing Durham Street to Durham
House Street.</p>

</p>
<p class="caption"> THE ADELPHI (DURHAM YARD AND THE NEW EXCHANGE) AND
CHARING CROSS, IN 1755.</p>

<p>One of the earliest of the literary inhabitants of Durham House was the
learned Richard de Bury (1281-1345), son of Sir Richard Aungerville. He
was tutor to Edward III., when Prince of Wales,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> and, subsequently,
was of the king's household. He was Dean of Wells and Bishop of Durham
in 1333, lord chancellor from September 1334 to July 1335, and lord
high treasurer in 1337. He was employed by the king in Paris and in
Hainault in 1336, and, in 1337 and 1342, in Scotland. It is pleasant
to think that he wrote his <i>Philobiblon</i> during his residence by the
Thames. At any rate, we may be sure that so learned and so useful a
man, one who had the confidence of the king for so long, was visited
here by Edward III.</p>

<p>Another name of note associated with Durham House is that of Thomas
Hatfield, already alluded to by Stow as having built that structure.
He probably added to it, or he may have rebuilt it. He was a great
prelate, and, in addition to the bishopric of Durham, which he held
from 1345 until his death in 1381, he was made keeper of the Privy Seal
in 1343, and, in 1346 and 1355, he accompanied Edward III. to France.
In Durham, he built part of the south side of the cathedral choir and
the hall of the castle, hence, possibly, the credit given to him by
Stow of building the Thames-side Durham House. His learned <i>Survey of
Durham</i> was edited by the Rev. William Greenwell in 1856.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from the joyous days of Prince Henry to the turbulent
times of Henry VIII., but the old chronicles do not contain any
mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> of Durham House during that lengthy period. In the reign of
the latter king, the then Bishop of Durham "conveyed the house to
the King in fee"; in other words, the noble Henry appropriated the
property to his own uses. He had the saving grace, however, to give
to the see of Durham, in exchange, some houses in Cold Harbour (now
marked by Upper Thames Street), and elsewhere. The exact date of the
transfer is unknown. The history of this bishop, who was made to
surrender Durham House to King Henry, is curious. Cuthbert Tunstall,
or Tonstall, was Master of the Rolls, and bishop successively of
London and Durham. Extolled by Erasmus, and the friend of Sir Thomas
More, he was learned in Greek, Hebrew, mathematics, and civil law.
Harrow-on-the-Hill had him for rector in 1511, he was prebendary
of Lincoln in 1514, archdeacon of Chester in the year following,
ambassador to the Prince of Castile at Brussels, 1515-1516, Master
of the Rolls in 1516, prebendary of York in 1519, and ambassador to
Charles V. in 1519, and again in 1525. He was Bishop of London from
1522-1530, keeper of the privy seal in 1523, and Bishop of Durham in
1530. It must have been after the latter year that he transferred
Durham House to Henry VIII. Accused of inciting to rebellion, 1550, he
was deprived of his bishopric of Durham by Edward VI., in 1552. Queen
Mary, however, restored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> him immediately on her accession, and he
remained in possession of Durham House&mdash;which Mary had also restored to
the see&mdash;until, in the year of his death, 1559, he was again deprived
by Queen Elizabeth, to whom he had refused the oath of supremacy.</p>

<p>A very interesting chapter in the history of Durham House came into
existence, thanks to its acquisition by Henry VIII., who granted it
to the Earl of Wiltshire (1477-1539), Thomas Boleyn, father of Queen
Anne Boleyn. It is not impossible that the Earl of Wiltshire was in
occupation of Durham House during the childhood of his daughter: at
any rate, it is certain that Anne's daughter, the Princess Elizabeth,
afterwards Queen, resided here.</p>

<p>Through Henry VIII. we get a glimpse of Cranmer at Durham House, for
that worthy wrote to the Earl of Wiltshire bidding him "let Doctor
Cranmer have entertainment in your house at Durham Place for a time, to
the intent he may bee there quiet to accomplish my request, and let him
lack neither bookes, ne anything requisite for his studies."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Cranmer
attended the Earl of Wiltshire as ambassador to Charles V. in 1530, and
it is probable that he lodged in Durham House in 1533, for in that year
he returned to England, gave formal sentence of the invalidity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
king's marriage with Catharine of Aragon, and pronounced King Henry's
marriage with Anne Boleyn to be lawful. So that it is easy to imagine
that the king's "request" occupied Cranmer's thoughts at Durham House,
and that Henry came here in order to confer with him.</p>

<p>That Henry VIII. was familiar with Durham House there is no room
for doubt, for, as the pious chronicler, Stow, quaintly puts it,
"in the year of Christ 1540," that being the thirty-second year of
Henry's reign, "on May-day, a great and triumphant jousting was
holden at Westminster, which had been formerly proclaimed in France,
Flanders, Scotland, and Spain, for all comers that would undertake
the challengers of England; which were, Sir John Dudley, Sir Thomas
Seymour, Sir Thomas Ponings, and Sir George Carew, knights, and Anthony
Kingston and Richard Cromwell, esquires; all which came into the lists
that day richly apparelled, and their horses trapped all in white
velvet. There came against them the said day forty-six defendants or
undertakers&mdash;viz., the Earl of Surrey, foremost, Lord William Howard,
Lord Clinton, and Lord Cromwell, son and heir to Thomas Cromwell, Earl
of Essex, and chamberlain of England, with other; and that day, after
the jousts performed, the challengers rode unto this Durham House,
where they kept open household, and feasted the King and Queen, with
her ladies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> and all the court. The second day Anthony Kingston and
Richard Cromwell were made knights there. The third day of May the said
challengers did tourney on horseback with swords, and against them
came forty-nine defendants&mdash;Sir John Dudley and the Earl of Surrey
running first, which at the first course lost their gauntlets; and that
day Sir Richard Cromwell overthrew Master Palmer and his horse in the
field, to the great honour of the challengers. The fifth of May the
challengers fought on foot at the barriers, and against them came fifty
defendants, which fought valiantly; but Sir Richard Cromwell overthrew
that day at the barriers Master Culpepper in the field; and the sixth
day the challengers brake up their household. In this time of their
housekeeping they had not only feasted the king, queen, ladies, and all
the court, as it is afore showed, but also they cheered all the knights
and burgesses of the common house in the parliament, and entertained
the Mayor of London, with the aldermen and their wives, at a dinner,
etc. The king gave to every of the said challengers and their heirs
for ever, in reward of their valiant activity, one hundred marks and a
house to dwell in, of yearly revenue, out of the lands pertaining to
the hospital of St John of Jerusalem, which he had confiscated."</p>

<p>From the merry-makings of "bluff King Hal" we turn to the more sober
employment of Durham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> House. Here, in 1550, were lodged the French
ambassador to Edward VI., Mons de Chastillon, and his colleagues, the
house being "furnished with hangings of the kings for the nonce." In
this year, also, Edward VI. granted Durham House for life, or until
she was otherwise advanced, to the Lady Elizabeth, afterwards Queen
Elizabeth; but, "in some way, it passed from the Princess to Dudley,
Duke of Northumberland, and was the principal London house when Edward
VI. died." I do not think that it is very difficult to account for
the transition. During the short reign of Edward VI., we find it
stated in Pennant that "the mint was established in this house, under
the management of Sir William Sharrington, and the influence of the
aspiring Thomas Seymour, lord admiral. Here he proposed to have money
enough coined to accomplish his designs on the throne. His practices
were detected, and he suffered death. His tool was also condemned;
but, sacrificing his master to his own safety, received a pardon, and
was again employed under the administration of John Dudley, Earl of
Northumberland."</p>

<p>This, I must confess, is a trifle vague. Sir William Sharington, or
Sherington&mdash;Pennant's Sharrington&mdash;vice-treasurer of the mint at
Bristol, assisted in the plots of Thomas Seymour, baron Seymour of
Sudeley, and was arrested and attainted, but subsequently pardoned. He
was sheriff of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> Wiltshire in 1552, and he died in 1553. Seymour was
found guilty of treason and executed in 1549, the second year of King
Edward VI. Is it not possible that the Duke of Northumberland received
Durham House in reward for his discovery there of the illegal mint? Be
this as it may, it certainly was the residence of John Dudley in May,
1553&mdash;the year of Edward's death. To quote once more from Pennant:
the Duke of Northumberland, in the month mentioned, "in this palace,
caused to be solemnised, with great magnificence, three marriages&mdash;his
son, Lord Guildford Dudley, with the amiable Lady Jane Grey; Lord
Herbert, heir to the Earl of Pembroke, with Catherine, younger sister
of Lady Jane; and Lord Hastings, heir to the Earl of Huntingdon, with
his youngest daughter, Lady Catherine Dudley. From hence he dragged
the reluctant victim, his daughter-in-law, to the Tower, there to be
invested with regal dignity. In eight short months his ambition led
the sweet innocent to the nuptial bed, the throne, and the scaffold."
It is, indeed, sad to think of the marriage rejoicings of Durham House
turned so speedily and so sadly into the sojourn in the dreaded Tower
and the execution of the bride-queen of seventeen summers.</p>

<p>On the accession of Mary, Durham House was restored to Bishop Tunstall,
but Queen Elizabeth acquired it in 1559, the year of Tunstall's death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
"The queen," said Bishop Goodman (1583-1656), in his <i>Court of James
I.</i>, "did not spare Cuthbert Tunstal, Bishop of Durham, though some
will not stick to say that he was her god-father; which, if he were
not, it is most certain that he was then present and did officiate
at her christening. But I think he was her god-father, because I am
certain he gave her Durham House in the Strand to dwell in, which she
kept during her life, and did not restore it to his successors, but
suffered Sir Walter Raleigh to live there. I remember when the Bishop
of Durham in the queen's time came up to Parliament, he was fain to
hire my schoolmaster's house" (Camden's) "in Westminster to lodge in."
It is a pity that we cannot agree with Goodman on this point, but, at
the time of Elizabeth's christening, 1533, Tunstall was faithful to
the Catholic dogma. It is also to be noted that Shakespeare makes the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Cranmer, pronounce the blessing on the infant
Elizabeth in <i>King Henry VIII.</i></p>

</p>

<p>From Queen Elizabeth we obtain a picture of two of the most
distinguished of the literary occupants of Durham House&mdash;Philip Sidney
and Walter Raleigh. In March, 1567-1568, Sir Henry Sidney writes from
it to Archbishop Parker for permission to eat meat in Lent for "my
boy Philip Sidney, who is somewhat subject to sickness." The future
soldier, statesman, and poet was then but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> child of thirteen, and
his presence there is one of the treasured memories of Durham House.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh was given the use of Durham House in 1583, and he
held it until his fall from favour in 1603. A picturesque glimpse of
him is afforded by Aubrey, the antiquary, who, although he was not
born until eight years after Raleigh's death, knew the Durham House of
that period. It was "a noble palace," he says. "After he" (Raleigh)
"came to his greatness, he lived there, or in some apartment of it.
I well remember his study, which was on a little turret that looked
into and over the Thames, and had the prospect which is as pleasant
perhaps as any in the world."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Many a time and oft did the young
favourite of the queen set out from Durham House, by water, for the
court of Elizabeth, and it is not inconceivable that Elizabeth, in
her royal barge, should have journeyed on more than one occasion from
her palace at Westminster to Raleigh's residence on the Thames. For,
during his early years here, Raleigh was in high favour. Then there
came the influence of the new favourite, Essex, Raleigh's intrigue
with Elizabeth Throgmorton, the queen's jealousy, and his commitment
to the Tower. He then settled at Sherbonne, and in 1595, 1596, and
1597, he was abroad on various expeditions. But he appears to have
retained possession of Durham House until the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> of Elizabeth's
reign&mdash;1603. In that year Tobias Mathew, the then Bishop of Durham, set
forth the claim of his see to the place, and Raleigh, in a letter of
remonstrance, states that he had been in possession of the house for
about twenty years, and that he had expended some two thousand pounds
upon it, out of his own purse. But James I. and the Council, on May 25
of that year, recognised the right of the see of Durham, and restored
the house to the successors of Bishop Hatfield.</p>

<p>Raleigh's letter, directed "to the Right Honorabell my verie good
Lords, the Lorde Keeper of the Great Seale and my Lorde Chiefe Justice
of Ingland, and to my verie good friende, His Majesties Atturney
Generall," is as follows:&mdash;"I received a warrant from your lordships,
my Lorde Keeper and my Lorde Chiefe Justice, and signed also by Mr
Atturney Generall, requiringe me to deliver the possession of Deram
House to the Byshoppe of Deram or to his Atturney before the xxiiiith
day of June next insuing, and that the stabells and gardens should be
presentlie putt into his hands.... This letter seemeth to me verie
strange, seeinge I have had the possession of the house almost xx
yeares, and have bestowed well neare 2000 L. uppon the same out of myne
owne purse. I am of opinion that if the King's Majestye had recovered
this house, or the like, from the meanest gentleman and sarvannt hee
had in Ing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>lande, that His Majestye would have geven six monenths tyme
for the avoydance, and I doo not know but the poorest artificer in
London hath a quarter's warninge geven him by his landlord. I have made
provision for 40 persons in the springe ... and now to cast out my hay
and oates into the streates att an hour's warninge, and to remove my
famyly and staff in 14 dayes after, is such a seveare expulsion as hath
not bynn offered to any man before this daye."</p>

<p>It is more than likely that Raleigh wrote several of his poems in
Durham House. His <i>Report of the Truth of the Fight about the Isles
of the Azores</i> (1591), and his <i>Discovery of the Empire of Guiana</i>
(1596), were published during his tenure of Durham House. Raleigh was
Lord Warden of the Stannaries, and, as such, many cases were brought
before him here, the most celebrated of them being that of Glanville
<i>v.</i> Courtney, which was heard at divers stages in 1591 and subsequent
years, Thomas Egerton (afterwards Baron Ellesmere), and Viscount
Brackley, lord chancellor, being counsel on one occasion. In 1600, when
Raleigh was away in Jersey, where he had been appointed governor, some
of the out-buildings of Durham House were destroyed by fire, and this
was the beginning of the end of the magnificence which had for so long
attended this palace on Thames-side.</p>

<p>Oldys, in his <i>Life of Raleigh</i>, has described the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> "stalwart,
sour-faced" statesman during his residence at Durham House, as attired
in a suit of clothes surmounted by jewels to the value of six thousand
six hundred gold pieces. The well-known story of Raleigh's first pipe
applies&mdash;if there is any truth in the legend&mdash;to the time when he
resided here. In 1586, Drake brought tobacco to England from Virginia.
It is said that one day Raleigh's servant, carrying a tankard of
spiced ale to Raleigh in his study in the turret, found his master on
fire, as he thought, and, dropping the vessel, rushed for assistance,
shouting that his master "would be burnt to ashes if they did not run
to his assistance." Another version is that the clown dashed the ale
over his master's head. Be this as it may, the early use of tobacco is
intimately associated with Durham House, for, as is well known, Raleigh
smoked as he worked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> for a moment Sir Walter Raleigh in his vain endeavour
to uphold his claim to Durham House, let us glance at the Strand
portion of the establishment. It teems with romance and literary
interest. The stabling, which looked upon the Strand, had fallen into
decay, and, early in the reign of James I., it was converted by Robert,
Lord Salisbury, into the New Exchange. Its frontage extended from the
present George Court to Durham House Street. The foundation stone was
laid on June 10, 1608, and, in the following July, as we find from the
State Papers, "The New Burse proceeds apace."</p>

<p>The allusion in the State Papers was due to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> letter which the Lord
Mayor had written, on June 30, to the Lord Treasurer, enclosing a
petition from the shopkeepers of the Royal Exchange "concerning a
building in course of erection at Durham House in the Strand," which
they considered was meant to be employed as "a Pawne or Exchange for
the sale of things usually uttered in the Royal Exchange, and which,
being situated near to Whitehall and in the highway, would be injurious
not only to the shopkeepers and citizens at large," but would tend to
the destruction of trade. Another authority says: "The new Bourse at
Durham House goes up apace, where the Citizens, and especially the
Exchange men, begin to grumble ... and thereupon have made a petition
to the Lord Mayor to provide <i>ne quid detrimenti republica capiet</i>."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Scant notice, if any, was taken of this petition from the City, and the
building of Britain's Burse proceeded without hindrance. The Exchange
consisted of four separate places: the Outward Walk below Stairs;
the Inner Walk below Stairs; the Outward Walk above Stairs; and the
Inner Walk above Stairs. Its opening, on April 11, 1609, was graced by
the presence of James I. and his queen, "when," according to Anthony
Munday, the poet and playwright and literary executor of Stow, whose
<i>Survey</i> he produced in 1618, "it pleased his most excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> Majesty,
because the work wanted a name, to entitle it Britain's Burse."</p>

<p>Stow also says: "Now to speak somewhat of later time concerning this
Durham House, it was well knowne and observed, for how many yeers I
know not, that the outward part belonging thereto, and standing North
from the houses, was but a low row of Stables, old, ruinous, ready
to fall, and very unsightly, in so public a passage to the Court at
Westminster. Upon which consideration, or some more especial respect in
the mind of the right honourable Robert, Earl of Salisbury, Lord High
Treasurer of England: it pleased him to take such order in the matter,
that (at his owne cost and charges), that deformed row of Stabling
was quite altered, by the erection of a very goodly and beautiful
building instead thereof, and in the very same place. Some shape of
the modelling, though not in all respects alike, was after the fashion
of the Royall Exchange in London, with Sellers underneath, a walk
fairly paved above it, and Rowes of Shops above, as also one beneath
answerable in manner to the other and intended for the like trades and
mysteries.</p>

<p>"The work was not long in the taking down, nor in the erection againe:
for the first stone was laid on the 10. day of June, 1608, and also was
fully finished in the next ensuing November after. Also, on Tuesday,
being the 10. day of April<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> following, divers of the upper shops were
adorned in rich and beautiful manner, with wares most curious to
please the eye; so ordered against his Majesties comming thither, to
give a name to so good a building. On the day following, it pleased
his highnesse, with the Queene, prince, the Duke of Yorke, and the
Lady Elizabeth to come thither, attended on by many great Lords and
choise Ladies. Concerning their entertainment there, though I was no
eye-witnesse thereof, yet I know the ingenuity and mind of the Nobleman
to be such, as nothing should want to welcome so great an expectation.
And therefore, what variety of devices, pleasing speeches, rich gifts
and presents as then flew bountifully abroad, I will rather referre
to your imagination, than any way come short of, by an imperfect
narration. Only this I adde, that it then pleased his most excellent
Majestie, because the worke wanted a name before, to entitle it
<i>Britaines Bursse</i>, or <i>Busse</i>."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>A most interesting description of the Royal visit, on the occasion
of the opening of the Exchange, was given by Marc' Antonio Correr,
the Venetian Ambassador in England, in a letter of May 6, 1609, to
the Doge and Senate of Venice. The original document is preserved in
the Venetian archives, and the following is a translation: "Hard by
the Court, the Earl of Salisbury has built two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> great galleries,
decorated, especially outside, with much carving and sculpture. Inside
each of these galleries, on either hand, are rows of shops for the sale
of all kinds of goods. These will bring in an immense revenue. Last
month, he took the King, the Queen, and the Princes to see them. He
has fitted up one of the shops very beautifully, and over it ran the
motto: 'All other places give for money, here all is given for love.'
To the King he gave a Cabinet, to the Queen a silver plaque of the
Annunciation, worth, they say, four thousand crowns. To the Prince, he
gave a horse's trappings of great value, nor was there any one of the
Suite who did not receive at the very least a gold ring."</p>

THE NEW EXCHANGE, STRAND.</p>

<p>The Exchange is thus described by Strype: "In the place where certain
old stables stood belonging to this house is the New Exchange, being
furnished with shops on both sides the walls, both below and above
stairs, for milleners, sempstresses, and other trades, that furnish
dresses; and is a place of great resort and trade for the nobility and
gentry, and such as have occasion for such commodities."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The connection of the Earl of Salisbury with the New Exchange, and,
incidentally, with the Durham House property, is somewhat curious. As
already observed, there had been a fire in part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> buildings, in
1600, and, as Salisbury House was adjacent, the neighbouring ruins must
have been an unpleasant prospect for the "crook-backed" and thrifty
earl. So he bought the Strand part of the ground from Sir Tobie Matthew
(1577-1655), who had secured from his father, Bishop Matthew, "an
interest in certain outlying portions of Durham House and its purlieus,
which was valuable enough to be purchased by Robert Cecil, in the year
following the Bishop's translation to York, for the sum of 1200 L."
This was in 1607, and, in 1609, he obtained a lease of the courtyard
of Durham House, the rest of the property remaining in the possession
of the see of Durham until 1630. Cecil, who had been created Earl of
Salisbury by James I. in 1605, was in high favour with the King at this
period, so that he was able to reply to the petition of the citizens
against his building of the Exchange "that Westminster being the place
where he was born and of his abode, he sees not but that he may seek to
benefit and beautify it" (J. Chamberlain to Dudley Carleton). At the
same time, he seems to have behaved fairly enough in another matter,
for on September 25, 1609, the then Bishop of Durham, William James,
wrote to Thomas Wilson, Lord Salisbury's steward, thanking the Earl for
causing stables to be built for him at Durham House, and requesting the
delivery of the key to his servant "in order that hay and straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> may be
provided there, against his coming up to Parliament."</p>

<p>The New Exchange was never a great rival of the old&mdash;the
Royal&mdash;Exchange, and, in 1623, only fourteen years after its opening,
there were rumours that it was to be converted into dwelling-houses.
"Lady Hatton," it was stated, "is said to have bought Britain's Burse
for 6000, and means to make the upper part her dwelling-house; the
lower part lets for 320 a year." The rumour was wrong, however, for
the place, although it fell into disrepute, existed until nearly the
middle of the seventeenth century&mdash;until, as a matter of fact, 1737.
Its most flourishing period was during the Restoration, when London
had doubled in population as compared with the reign of James I., and
Covent Garden was the fashionable quarter. There is hardly a dramatist
of Charles II.'s time whose works do not contain some reference to
it, while one of the playwrights, Thomas Duffet, had been a milliner
in this very place before he took to burlesquing Dryden, D'Avenant,
and the contemporary writers. The Grand Duke Cosmo gives an accurate
picture of the place as it was in Charles II.'s time: "We went to see
the New Exchange, which is not far from the place of the Common Garden,
in the great street called the Strand. The building has a faade of
stone, built after the Gothic style, which has lost its colour from
age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> and become blackish. It contains two long and double galleries,
one above the other, in which are distributed, in several rows, great
numbers of very rich shops of drapers and mercers filled with goods of
every kind, and with manufactures of the most beautiful description.
These are for the most part under the care of well-dressed women, who
are busily employed in work, although many are served by young men
called apprentices."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The stage has a great claim upon the history of the Adelphi, not only
by reason of Garrick's residence here, but because the first edition
of <i>Othello</i> was published within its precincts. This was in 1622, six
years after Shakespeare's death, and a year before the issue of the
first folio. The title-page of this quarto is as follows:</p>

<p class="center">

<p>A player and publisher of plays, Will Cademan, lived at the Pope's
Head, in the Lower Walk. Samuel Pepys was a visitor to the New Exchange
on several occasions. On June 22, 1668, the diarist went to the King's
playhouse and saw "an act or two" of Dryden's comedy, <i>An Evening's
Love, or the Mock Astrologer</i>, but "liked it not. Calling this day at
Herringman's, he tells me Dryden do himself call it but a fifth-rate
play." Henry Herringman, who was the principal publisher in London
before Jacob Tonson, had his shop "At the Sign of the Blue Anchor"
in the Lower Walk of the New Exchange. Here, in 1679, was published
Horace's <i>Art of Poetry</i>, "made English" by the Right Hon. the Earl of
Roscommon. Otway, in the character of Mrs Furnish, in <i>The Atheist,
or the Soldier's Fortune</i>, first acted in 1682, gives a good idea of
the cries in the Upper Walk of the New Exchange: "Gloves or ribands,
sir? Very good gloves or ribands. Choice of fine essences." The Strand
houses near the Exchange were let to "country gentlewomen newly come
to town, who loved to lodge in the very centre of fashion." Pert, in
Sir George Etherege's comedy, <i>The Man of Mode</i> (1676), says: "That
place is never without a nest of 'em. They are always, as one goes by,
glaring in balconies or staring out of windows." In another play by the
same author, <i>She Would if She Could</i> (1668), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> <i>The Country Wife</i>
(1675) of Wycherley, scenes are laid in the New Exchange. Dryden, who
was well acquainted with the place, makes Mrs Brainsick escape from her
husband by pretending to call at her tailor's here "to try her stays
for a new gown."</p>

<p>Such a place, in such an age, was bound to deteriorate. In Addison's
day, the gallants of the town spent much of their time in lounging
about the stalls and indulging in ribald talk. "I have long letters,"
he says in the <i>Spectator</i>, "both from the Royal and New Exchange on
the" subject of the indecent licenses taken in discourse. "They tell
me that a young Fop cannot buy a Pair of Gloves, but he is at the
same time straining for some Ingenious Ribaldry to say to the young
Woman who helps them on. It is no small Addition to the Calamity, that
the Rogues buy as hard as the plainest and modestest Customers they

<p>Returning to Durham House, we recall that, on the death of Queen
Elizabeth, the property was restored to the see of Durham and that Lord
Salisbury had become possessed of the Strand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> portion. The history
shortly after this period is not particularly clear, for, although on
February 16, 1612, we find that the aforesaid William James, Bishop
of Durham, wrote to Lord Salisbury thanking him for his "honourable
dealings in the purchase of Durham House," on the other hand, John
Howson, who was Bishop of Durham from 1628 to the year of his death,
1632, was residing here two years prior to his decease. The "honourable
dealings," of course, related to that part of the grounds and stabling
of Durham House which had been transferred to Lord Salisbury in
1607 and 1609. Durham House itself fell into decay in the middle of
the seventeenth century. It&mdash;or a portion of it&mdash;was inhabited by
Lord-Keeper Coventry, who died here in 1640.</p>

<p>Part of the ground was acquired by Philip Herbert, Earl of Pembroke and
Montgomery, in consideration of his payment to the see of Durham of
200 per annum, the grant being confirmed by Act of Parliament in 1640.
And, according to Strype, "It was by his son built into tenements or
houses, as now they are standing, being a handsome street descending
down out of the Strand." This was Durham Yard, which ran down to the
river, and is now covered by the buildings on the west side of the
Adelphi. In 1667-1668, the office of Commissioners for Accounts was in
Durham Yard, and we get an interesting word-picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> of it from the
pages of Samuel Pepys. On January 31, "Up," he recorded, "by coach,
with W. Griffin with me, and our Contract-books, to Durham Yard, to
the Commissioners for Accounts; the first time I ever was there; and
staid awhile before I was admitted to them. I did observe a great many
people attending about complaints of seamen concerning tickets, and
among others Mr Carcasse, and Mr Martin, my purser. And I observe a
fellow, one Collins, is there, who is employed by these Commissioners
particularly to hold an office in Bishopsgate Street, or somewhere
thereabouts, to receive complaints of all people about tickets; and I
believe he will have work enough. Presently I was called in, where I
found the whole number of Commissioners, and was there received with
great respect and kindness; and did give them great satisfaction,
making it my endeavour to inform them what it was they were to expect
from me, and what was the duty of other people; this being my only way
to preserve myself, after all my pains and trouble. They did ask many
questions, and demanded other books of me, which I did give them very
ready and acceptable answers to; and, upon the whole, I do observe they
do go about their business like men resolved to go through with it, and
in a very good method, like men of understanding. They have Mr Jessop,
their secretary; and it is pretty to see that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> are fain to find
out an old-fashioned man of Cromwell's to do their business for them,
as well as the Parliament to pitch upon such for the most part in the
lowest of people that were brought into the House for Commissioners.
I went away giving and receiving great satisfaction." Various other
public offices were in Durham Yard at this period. In 1664, the Coal
Meter's Office was here, and, in 1675, His Majesty's Office for
granting wine licenses.</p>

<p>On April 26, 1669, Pepys records: "A great fire happened in Durham Yard
last night, burning the house of one Lady Hungerford, who was to come
to town to it this night; and so the house is burned, new furnished,
by carelessness of the girl sent to take off a candle from a bunch of
candles, which she did by burning it off, and left the rest, as it is
supposed, on fire. The King and Court were here, it seems, and stopped
the fire by blowing up the next house." The Merry Monarch, having
stopped the fire in Durham Yard, was up betimes next morning and off to
Newmarket.</p>

<p>Several other side-lights on the subject are furnished by Pepys.
Thus, on February 1, 1663-1664, he notes that, "I hear how two men
last night, justling for the wall about the New Exchange, did kill
one another, each thrusting the other through; one of them of the
King's Chapel, one Cave, and the other a retayner of my Lord Generall
Middleton's." In the year of the Great Fire, 1666, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> "up by five
o'clock" on September 7, "and, blessed be God! find all well; and by
water to Pane's Wharfe. Walked thence, and saw all the towne burned,
and a miserable sight of Paul's church, with all the roofs fallen,
and the body of the quire fallen into St Fayth's; Paul's school also,
Ludgate, and Fleet Street. My father's house, and the church, and a
good part of the Temple the like. So to Creed's lodging, near the
New Exchange, and there find him laid down upon a bed; the house all
unfurnished, there being fears of the fire's coming to them. There
borrowed a shirt of him, and washed. To Sir W. Coventry, at St James's,
who lay without curtains, having removed all his goods; as the King at
White Hall, and everybody had done, and was doing." Three months later,
the "very good newes is just come of our four ships from Smyrna, come
safe without convoy even into the Downes, without seeing any enemy;
which is the best, and, indeed, only considerable good news to our
Exchange since the burning of the City; and it is strange to see how
it do cheer up men's hearts. Here I saw shops now come to be in this
Exchange; and met little Batelier who sits here but at 3 L. per annum,
whereas he sat at the other at 100 L.; which he says he believes will
prove as good account to him now as the other did at that rent."</p>

<p>Dean Crofts of Norwich and various others of some standing were living
in Durham Yard in 1675,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> and in that year some waterworks, which are
not to be confused with those of the York Buildings company, were
established by Sir Robert Vyner and others. In 1677, Durham Yard had
gone to ruin, and was notorious as a place of ill repute. In April
of that year Le Tellier, Archbishop and Duke of Rheims, crossed the
Channel in order to "treat about a marriage with the Lady Mary,
daughter of the Duke of York, with the Dauphin." In some ribald verses
by the libellous Anthony Wood (or, as he dubbed himself, Anthony 
Wood, 1632-1695) we read that:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
"The Bishop who from France came slowly o'er<br />
Did go to Betty Beaulie's"&mdash;
</p>

<p>this Betty being a person of notorious character who lived in Durham
Yard. Dryden, in his 1667 comedy, <i>Sir Martin Marrall</i>, makes Lady Dupe
refer to Durham Yard as the customary landing-place for Covent Garden.
And <i>The Tatler</i> of June 7, 1709, alludes to "a certain lady who left
her coach at the New Exchange door in the Strand, and whipt down Durham
Yard into a boat with a young gentleman for Fox Hall."</p>

<p>Durham Yard was the first residence in London (1675) of Godfrey
Kneller. David Garrick and Samuel Johnson are closely connected
with the place. It was here that the volatile Garrick, at the age
of twenty-three, was in partnership with his brother, Peter, as a
wine-merchant. I do not think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> that he lived here, but, certainly,
the brothers had their wine vaults in Durham Yard. But the union did
not last long. "Peter was calm, sedate, and methodical; David was gay,
volatile, and impetuous, and, perhaps, not so confined to regularity
as his partner could have wished." Therefore, as Garrick's biographer,
Thomas Davies, puts it, "to prevent the continuance of fruitless
and daily altercation," friends intervened, and the partnership was
dissolved amicably. Another most interesting memory of Durham Yard is
associated with Garrick's friend, Samuel Johnson, who, at the time
of the wine partnership, was living (March, 1741) "at the Black Boy
over against Durham Yard"&mdash;this is not to be confused with Johnson's
"garret," which was in Exeter Street, Strand. Samuel Foote, in his
ill-natured way, used to say that he remembered "Davy" in Durham
Yard "with three quarts of vinegar in the cellar, calling himself a
wine merchant." Thanks to wine, we have another notable association
with Durham Yard. Here was a wine merchant named Brisden, whose shop
was frequented by Voltaire. On his return to France, Voltaire wrote
to "Dear John," wishing him "good health and a quick sale to your
Burgundy." He knew this neighbourhood well, for, during his abode in
England, 1726-1729, he constantly visited his friend Congreve, the
dramatist, in Surrey Street, Strand. Voltaire lodged in Maiden Lane,
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> few yards from the Adelphi, over a French barber's shop, which
was distinguished by the sign of the White Peruke. He was thoroughly
familiar with English, and, on one occasion, a mob of roughs assailed
him and twitted him for being&mdash;his appearance left no doubt as to his
nationality&mdash;a "Frenchy." Voltaire nimbly "mounted an adjacent doorstep
and addressed the crowd in good English, extolling the liberty of
England and the people. His speech was a success. The mob took on at
once, and cheered him; eventually they mounted him on the shoulders of
a couple of stout fellows and carried him in triumph to his lodgings.
Never after that was he molested in his walks."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Leigh Hunt, in <i>The Town</i>, describing Voltaire's visit to England,
says that he wrote to Swift from Maiden Lane, in English, but that the
language "seems a little too perfect." There is a second letter to
Swift "which looks more authentic. But there is no doubt that Voltaire,
while in England, made himself such a master of the language as to be
able to write in it with a singular correctness for a foreigner. He
was then young. He had been imprisoned in the Bastille for a libel,
came over here on his release; procured many subscriptions for the
<i>Henriade</i>; published in English an essay on epic poetry, and remained
some years, during which he became acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> the principal men
of letters&mdash;Pope, Congreve, and Young. He is said to have talked so
indecently at Pope's table (probably no more than was thought decent
by the belles in France) that the good old lady, the poet's mother,
was obliged to retire. Objecting, at Lord Chesterfield's table, to
the allegories of Milton, Young is said to have accosted him in the
well-known couplet:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Thou art so witty, profligate, and thin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thou seem'st a Milton, with his Death and Sin.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>But this story has been doubted. Young, though not so thin, was
as witty and profligate in his way as Voltaire; for, even when
affecting a hermit-like sense of religion, he was a servile
flatterer and preferment-hunter. The secret of the gloomy tone in
his <i>Night-Thoughts</i> was his not having too much, and his missing a
bishopric. This is the reason why the <i>Night-Thoughts</i> are overdone,
and have not stood their ground. Voltaire left England with such a
mass of subscriptions for his <i>Henriade</i> as laid the foundation of
his fortunes, and with great admiration of English talent and genius,
particularly that of Newton and Locke, which, with all his insinuations
against our poetry, he took warm pains to extend and never gave up.
He was fond to the last of showing he had not forgotten his English.
Somebody telling him that Johnson had spoken well of his talents, he
said, in English, 'He is a clever fellow'; but the gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>man observing
that the doctor did not think well of his religion, he added, 'A
superstitious dog.'"</p>

<p>An affair which had a tragic ending occurred in the New Exchange in
1653. The circumstances are fully related in the <i>State Papers</i>. In
the winter of that year there came to England an ambassador from the
King of Portugal, with a very splendid equipage; and in his retinue his
brother, Don Pantaleon de Sa, a Knight of Malta, and "a gentleman of a
haughty and imperious nature." One day in November, Don Pantaleon was
walking with two friends in the Exchange, when a quarrel arose between
them and a young English gentleman, named Gerard, who accused the
Portuguese of speaking in French disparagingly of England. One of the
Portuguese gave Mr Gerard the lie, and then began to jostle him; swords
were drawn, and all three fell upon Gerard, and one of them stabbed him
with his dagger in the shoulder. A few unarmed Englishmen interfered,
separated the combatants, and got the Portuguese out of the Exchange,
one of them with a cut upon his cheek.</p>

<p>On the next evening, Don Pantaleon came to take his revenge,
accompanied by fifty followers; "two Knights of Malta led on by
a Portuguese Captain in buff; all having generally double arms,
swords and pistols, and coats of mail; two or three coaches brought
ammunition, hand-grenades, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> bottles, and little barrels of powder
and bullets; and boats were provided ready at the water-side. They had
resolved to fall upon every Englishman they should find in or about
the Exchange. They entered all with drawn swords; the people fled for
shelter into the shops; there were few Englishmen present, but of
these four were severely wounded by the Portuguese." A Mr Greenaway,
of Lincoln's Inn, was walking with his sister and a lady whom he was
to have married. These he placed for safety in a shop; he then went
to see what was the matter, when the Portuguese, mistaking Greenaway
for Gerard, gave the word, and he was killed by a pistol shot through
the head. The crowd grew enraged, and Don Pantaleon and the Portuguese
retreated to the house of embassy, caused the gates to be shut, and put
all the servants in arms to defend it. Meanwhile the Horse Guard on
duty had apprehended some of the Portuguese, and Cromwell sent Colonel
Whaley in command, who pursued others to the ambassador's house with
his horse, and there demanded that the rest should be given up. The
Ambassador insisted upon his privilege, and that by the law of nations
his house was a sanctuary for all his countrymen; but finding the
officer resolute, and that he was not strong enough for the encounter,
desired time to send to the Lord General Cromwell, which was granted,
and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> complained of the injury, and desired an audience. Cromwell
sent a messenger in reply, to state that a gentleman had been murdered,
and several other persons wounded, and that if the criminals were not
given up, the soldiers would be withdrawn, and "the people would pull
down the house, and execute justice themselves." Under this threat,
Don Pantaleon, three of his retainers, and an English boy, the Don's
servant, were given up; they were confined in the guard-house for the
night, and next day sent prisoners to Newgate, whence, in about three
weeks, the Don made his escape, but was retaken.</p>

<p>By the intercession of the Portuguese merchants, the trial was delayed
till the 6th of July in the following year, when the prisoners were
arraigned for the crime of murder. Don Pantaleon at first refused to
plead, as he held a commission to act as Ambassador in the event of
his brother's death or absence from England. He was then threatened
with "the press," that horrible form of torture, pressing to death, or
<i>peine forte et dure</i>, whereupon he pleaded not guilty.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> A jury of
English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> foreigners brought in a verdict of guilty, and the five
prisoners were sentenced to be hanged. Every effort was made to save
Don Pantaleon's life; but Cromwell's reply was: "Blood has been shed,
and justice must be satisfied." The only mercy shown was a respite of
two days, and a reprieve from the disgraceful death of hanging; the
Ambassador having craved permission to kill his brother with his own
sword, rather than he should be hanged.</p>

<p>A remarkable coincidence concluded this strange story. While Don
Pantaleon lay in Newgate, awaiting his trial, Gerard, with whom
the quarrel in the Exchange had arisen, got entangled in a plot to
assassinate Cromwell, was tried and condemned to be hanged, which,
as in the Don's case, was changed to beheading. Both suffered on the
same day, on Tower Hill. Don Pantaleon, attended by a number of his
brother's suite, was conveyed in a mourning-coach with six horses,
from Newgate to Tower Hill, to the same scaffold whereon Gerard had
just suffered. The Don, after his devotions, gave his confessor his
beads and crucifix, laid his head on the block, and it was chopped off
at two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> blows. On the same day, the English boy-servant was hanged at
Tyburn. The three retainers were pardoned. Pennant says that Gerard
died "with intrepid dignity; the Portuguese with all the pusillanimity
of an assassin." Cromwell's stern and haughty justice, and the perfect
retribution exacted on this occasion, have been much extolled.
His decision tended to render his Government still more respected
abroad; and it settled a knotty point as to "the inviolability of
ambassadors."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> romantic story of the White Widow, or the White Milliner,
otherwise Frances Jennings, Duchess of Tyrconnel, wife of Richard
Talbot, Lord Deputy of Ireland in the reign of James II., plays a
large part in the history of the Adelphi. In the Revolution of 1688
the duchess sold small articles of haberdashery for a few days in the
New Exchange. According to Horace Walpole, "She wore a white dress
wrapping her whole person, and a white mask, which she never removed,
and excited much interest and curiosity." Her case becoming known, "she
was provided for." The association of Richard Talbot's widow with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Adelphi is very curious. This lady, Frances Jennings, was sister to
the celebrated Duchess of Marlborough. By her first husband, George,
Count Hamilton, a member of the Abercorn family, and a <i>marchal de
camp</i> in the French service, she had three daughters: Elizabeth,
afterwards the wife of Viscount Ross; Frances, wife of Viscount Dillon;
and Mary, wife of Viscount Kingsland. On the death of Count Hamilton,
she married Colonel Richard Talbot, Baron of Talbot's Town, Viscount
of Baltinglass, and Earl of Tyrconnel. On March 20, 1688, James II.
created him Marquess and Duke of Tyrconnel. On his death, in 1691,
his widow was left with two daughters, one of whom became Princess of
Vintimiglia.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Walpole states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> that the duchess, on her arrival in
England in 1688, was reduced to absolute want, and, being unable to
procure safe access to her family, she adopted the disguise of the
White Milliner as a temporary means of livelihood. Be this as it may,
the duchess must have had money in her widowhood, for shortly after
the death of her husband, and despite the penal laws against the Roman
Catholics, she established a convent for Poor Clares in King Street,
Dublin, and in this city, at the ripe old age of ninety-two, she died,
according to Horace Walpole, "in consequence of falling out of bed upon
the floor on a winter's night. Being too feeble to rise or call for
aid, she was found in the morning so numbed by the cold that she lived
only a few hours." She was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral on March 9,
1730. Walpole describes her as "Of very low stature, extremely thin,
and without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> least trace of in her features of ever having been a
beauty."</p>

<p>Whatever she may have been in her old age, she was pretty and graceful
in her youth when at the court of Charles II. Count de Grammont states
that she was proof against all the wiles of the Merry Monarch, yet
her spirits were such that on one occasion she attired herself as an
orange-wench in order to have her fortune told in the neighbourhood of
St James's.</p>

<p>While the beauty and unusual propriety of the new-comer were still
attracting the attention of the Court, the giddy girl was indiscreet
enough to embark in a wild frolic, which very nearly had the effect of
ruining her hitherto stainless reputation. The adventure in question,
which has been chronicled by more than one contemporary writer, is thus
recorded by Pepys: "What mad freaks," he says, "the Mayds of Honour at
Court have! That Mrs Jennings, one of the Dutchesse's maids, the other
day dressed herself like an orange wench, and went up and down and
cried oranges; till, falling down, or by some accident, her fine shoes
were discovered, and she put to a great deal of shame." The particulars
of the adventure are so interesting that they may be related in these
pages.</p>

<p>"Lord Rochester, at this time in disgrace at Court, happened to be
consoling himself for the King's displeasure by performing, in an
obscure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> corner of the city, the character of a German empiric and
fortune-teller. The success of his celebrated frolic is well known. His
fame, which at first had been merely local, had gradually spread itself
abroad till at last it reached the ears of the Court. Rochester was of
course equally as well acquainted with the scandal of the day as with
the persons and characters of those who figured in the licentious Court
of his royal master. Accordingly, having recognised one or two of the
female attendants of the maids of honour, who had eagerly flocked to
consult him, he sent them back so amazed by his superhuman powers as
to excite the curiosity of their mistresses. The result fully answered
Rochester's expectations. Under the protection of the then fashionable
mask, there was more than one giddy maid of honour who made up her mind
to dive into the secrets of futurity by means of the German mountebank.
Who, indeed, could gravely blame them, when even the Queen herself had
set the example of risking her reputation, by indulging in similar
masquerading frolics?</p>

<p>"Among those whose curiosity was thus excited were Miss Jennings and
Miss Price, the latter, a young lady of indifferent reputation, who had
formerly been a maid of honour to the Duchess of York. Miss Jennings,
young and indiscreet, believing that as long as she preserved her
virtue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> it mattered little how she obtained amusement, easily enlisted
her friend in her mad schemes. Accordingly, having provided themselves
with the dresses of orange-girls (a garb usually worn by the least
reputable members of society), they issued from St James's Palace, and,
crossing the park on foot, entered a hackney-coach at Whitehall.</p>

<p>"They had nearly reached the theatre, where they knew the Duchess to
be in person, when Miss Price had the imprudence to propose their
joining the real orange-girls and selling their fruit in the face of
the Court. As they entered the theatre, they encountered 'the handsome
Sydney,' who was just alighting from his carriage. Miss Price offered
him her basket; but the dandy, either lost in the contemplation of his
own charms, or of those of his mistress, the Duchess of York, took no
notice of the masqueraders. Their next adventure was with Killegrew, to
whom Miss Jennings timidly held out her basket, while the other, in the
cant language of the place, requested him to buy 'her fine oranges.'
The challenge was met by the libertine in the kind of manner that
might have been expected. He even gave proof of his admiration of Miss
Jennings by so rude an homage as to bring the blush to her cheek and
the fire to her eye. Leaving Killegrew to enjoy a hearty laugh at the
preposterous notion of the existence of a virtuous orange-girl, Miss
Price hastily dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> away her friend, whom terror and indignation had
rendered nearly powerless.</p>

<p>"Their fright, however, was insufficient to prevent their pursuing the
original frolic of the evening. Having entered another hackney-coach,
they were on the point of alighting within a few doors of the
fortune-teller's, when, to their consternation, they encountered a
far more dangerous person than Killegrew. This was no other than
the immoral and licentious Brouncker, who, having been dining with
a merchant in the neighbourhood, was on his way homewards, when the
novelty of seeing two orange-girls in a hackney-coach attracted his
attention. Perceiving themselves to be objects of curiosity to so
dangerous a libertine, they desired their coachman to drive on, and
to put them down in another part of the street. Brouncker, however,
stealthily followed them; nor was his astonishment diminished, when
he perceived that the shoes and stockings, that covered the pretty
feet and ankles which alighted from the vehicle, were of a quality
strangely at variance with the rest of the costume. Having contrived
to obtain a glimpse of their faces, which they vainly endeavoured to
conceal from him, he at once recognised the beautiful maid of honour,
on whose motives for disguise he naturally put the worst possible
construction. Believing that an assignation on the part of the chaste
Miss Jennings was at the bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> frolic, and delighted with the
tale of scandal with which he had it in his power to amuse the Court,
he continued to tease the frightened girls for a short time, without
betraying that he had recognised them, and then laughingly wished them
good-night.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately the disagreeable adventures of the night were not yet at
an end. During the time that the two maids of honour had been enduring
the impertinences and libertine proposals of Brouncker, a crowd of
blackguard boys, not contented with collecting round their coach, had
made a violent attack on their orange baskets. The coachman had taken
the part of his fare; and, in consequence of his gallantly resisting
the attempts of the depredators, a fight had ensued and the street was
in an uproar. The fruit, of course, was only too gladly relinquished to
the mob, from whom, notwithstanding, the presumed orange-girls received
a volley of abuse and ridicule. Finally, though with some difficulty,
they contrived to re-enter their coach, and at last arrived, completely
frightened and dispirited, at St James's."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It was to the Duchess of Tyrconnel, as she then was, that James II.
had to relate the melancholy story of his defeat at the battle of the
Boyne: "Soon after sunset, James, escorted by two hundred cavalry, rode
into the Castle [Dublin]. At the threshold he was met by the wife of
Tyrconnel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> once the gay and beautiful Fanny Jennings, the loveliest
coquette in the brilliant Whitehall of the Restoration. To her the
vanquished King had to relate the ruin of her fortunes and of his
own."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Jesse regards the connection of the Duchess of Tyrconnel with
the New Exchange as "apocryphal." But we have the authority of Walpole
and Pennant for the anecdote, and I see no reason to doubt its accuracy.</p>

<p>The romance of the White Milliner of the Adelphi afforded Douglas
Jerrold material for a two-act comedy, which Madame Vestris produced at
Covent Garden on February 9, 1841. The author of <i>Black-eyed Susan</i> was
apparently suffering from some slight at the hands of the critics, for
he takes them to task soundly in his Preface to <i>The White Milliner</i>,
as his play was called. Having related the incident which gave rise
to the piece, he goes on to say: "In our day, the dramatist who keeps
aloof from a small faction&mdash;which almost avowedly adopts for its motto
the dogma of Molire,&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Nul n'aura de l'esprit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hors nous et nos amis,'&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>may look for the most unrelenting opposition from two or three stalwart
critics, or, rather, literary vassals. Fortunately, however, the
despicable partisanship of these people is now too well known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> to be
hurtful. Whether they chronicle their injustice in bold falsehood, or
with an affectation of candour, examine a drama to find in it nothing
but what is contemptible, the disinterested motive is equally manifest.
However, the abuse of these folks, like certain poisons long exposed to
light, does not destroy&mdash;it only nauseates."</p>

<p>The cast of <i>The White Milliner</i> was remarkably strong. It contained,
in addition to Madame Vestris, who played the heroine, Albina, Charles
Mathews, James Vining, Robert Keeley, and William Farren. The opening
scene is the "Exterior of England's Burse." The last scene of the first
act is laid in the interior of the New Exchange. A crowd of milliners,
with Doddles, the Beadle of the Burse, in the centre, fill the stage:</p>

<p>In commenting on the failure of <i>The White Milliner</i>, Jerrold's son,
Blanchard Jerrold, wrote that the "author was bitterly disappointed
that its pointed and tender dialogue, and its brisk action, failed to
achieve success; more,&mdash;as may be gathered from his own words,&mdash;that
personal enmity, carried dishonestly into public criticism, sought to
put it aside as a thing in all respects worthless." It was not long,
however, before <i>Mrs Caudle's Curtain Lectures</i> gave Jerrold a foremost
place as a wit and removed him far beyond the petty spite which had
helped towards the failure of <i>The White Milliner</i>.</p>

<p>Another personage of greater note, although of lower birth, than the
Duchess of Tyrconnel, connected with the history of the New Exchange,
is "Nan" Clarges, subsequently Duchess of Albemarle. This remarkable
woman was the daughter of John Clarges, a blacksmith and farrier,
who lived in Drury Lane, at the Strand end, a spot now obliterated.
Her mother was one of five women-barbers of notorious disrepute. A
contemporary ballad has the refrain:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"Did you ever hear the like,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Or ever hear the fame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of five women barbers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who lived in Drury Lane?"</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Lives and Adventures of Whitney, John Cottington</i> alias
<i>Mul-Sack, and Thomas Waters</i> (1753), there is a reference to these
women: "They were five noted amazons in Drury Lane, who were called
women-shavers, and whose actions were then talked of much about town;
till being apprehended for a riot, and one or two of them severely
punished, the rest fled to Barbadoes." Such an origin was not very
promising; but Anne Clarges, when she was married to General Monk,
upheld her position despite her personal disadvantages, for she was
ill-favoured in appearance and by no means cleanly in her habits.</p>

<p>Anne Clarges was married, in 1632, to one Thomas Ratford, son to
a farrier who resided in the Royal Mews at Bloomsbury. She had a
daughter, who was born in 1634, and died four years later. She had been
instructed in the trade of a milliner, and this led to her taking up
her abode, after her marriage, at the Three Spanish Gipsies, in the
New Exchange. Here she sold wash-balls, powder, gloves, and similar
articles, and gave lessons to girls in plain needlework. In 1647, being
then sempstress to Colonel Monk, she was in the habit of carrying his
linen to him. This was the beginning of her intimacy with the famous
soldier. Her parents died in 1648, and, in the following year, she
quarrelled with her husband, who apparently left her. At any rate, from
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> date nothing more was heard of him. When Monk was a prisoner
in the Tower&mdash;1644-1646&mdash;Anne Ratford became his mistress, and had a
child of which he was the father&mdash;hence, no doubt, the reason of her
separation from her husband.</p>

<p>In an action for trespass, tried in the Court of King's Bench, on
November 15, 1700, William Sherwin being the plaintiff and Sir William
Clarges, Bart., being the chief defendant, it was proved that Anne
Clarges, or Ratford, was, in 1652, married in the Church of St George,
Southwark, to General George Monk, and further, that in the course of
the following year she was delivered of a son (afterwards the second
Duke of Ablemarle), who was suckled by one Honour Mills, a vendor of
apples, herbs, and oysters. The point of issue was the right and title
to the manor of Sutton in Yorkshire, and other lands&mdash;the plaintiff
claiming them as heir-at-law and representative to Thomas Monk, elder
brother to the first duke of Albemarle, and the defendant as devisee
under the will of Christopher, the second duke. The only material point
to be decided was, whether Ratford was actually deceased at the period
of the marriage of his supposed widow with Monk. On the side of the
plaintiff it was sworn by one witness that he had seen Ratford alive
about the month of July, 1660, as many as eight years after the second
marriage. Another witness affirmed that he had seen him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> late as the
year 1665, and a second time after the Duke and Duchess of Albemarle
were both dead; and thirdly, a woman swore that she had seen him on the
very day that his wife (then called Duchess of Albemarle) was placed
in her coffin. On the part of the defendant, and in opposition to this
evidence, were alleged the material facts that during the lives of the
Duke of Albemarle and his son the matter had never been questioned,
and, moreover, that the defendant had already thrice obtained verdicts
in his favour in the Court of King's Bench. Some other presumptive
evidence was adduced, but of less weight. In summing up, the Lord
Chief-Justice told the Jury: "If you are certain that Duke Christopher
was born while Thomas Ratford was living, you must find for the
plaintiff. If you believe he was born after Ratford was dead, or that
nothing appears what became of him after Duke George married his wife,
you must find for the defendant." The verdict was in favour of the
latter.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>According to contemporary evidence, the Duchess of Albemarle was a low,
foul-mouthed creature, of exceedingly coarse habits. "Monk," says Lord
Clarendon in his <i>History</i>, "was cursed, after a long familiarity, to
marry a woman of the lowest extraction, the least wit, and less beauty.
She was a woman <i>nihil muliebris prter corpus gerens</i>," one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> who had
nothing feminine but her form. In the opinion of Bishop Burnet, she was
a "ravenous, mean, and contemptible creature, who thought of nothing
but getting and spending." Pepys could not endure her. On March 8,
1661, he met her in "high company," and put her down as "even a plain,
homely dowdy." On December 9, 1665, Pepys and "my Lord Brouncker" dined
with the Duke of Albemarle. "At table the duchess, a very ill-looked
woman, complaining of her lord's going to sea the next year, said these
cursed words: 'If my Lord had been a coward he had gone to sea no more:
it may be then he might have been excused, and made an embassador'
(meaning my Lord Sandwich). This made me mad, and I believed she
perceived my countenance change, and blushed herself very much. I was
in hopes others had not minded it, but my Lord Brouncker, after we were
come away, took notice of the words to me with displeasure." In the
following year, on November 4, he alludes to the duke as "a drunken
sot," who "drinks with nobody but Troutbecke, whom nobody else will
keep company with. Of whom he told me this story; that once the Duke
of Albemarle in his drink, taking notice as of a wonder that Nan Hide
should ever come to be Duchess of York: 'Nay,' says Troutbecke, 'ne'er
wonder at that; for if you will give me another bottle of wine, I will
tell you as great, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> not greater, a miracle.' And what was that, but
that our dirty Besse (meaning his duchesse) should come to be Duchesse
of Albemarle?" Monk, it was said, was more in fear of his wife than
of an army, and it was reported that she did not hesitate to thrash
him at times, but the latter statement is probably an exaggeration.
There is no doubt about her loyalty to the Royalist cause; she exerted
great influence over Monk, and urged him immensely in his efforts in
bringing about the Restoration. In his <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>,
D'Israeli cites a passage from a manuscript of Sir Thomas Browne which
throws a strange light on Monk's conduct in regard to the Restoration
and the part played in it by the blacksmith's daughter: "Monk gave fair
promises to the Rump; but at last agreed with the French ambassador to
take the government on himself; by whom he had promise from Mazarin of
assistance from France. This bargain was struck late at night; but not
so secretly but that Monk's wife, who had posted herself conveniently
behind the hangings, finding what was resolved upon, sent her brother
Clarges away immediately with notice of it to Sir A. She had promised
to watch her husband, and inform Sir A. how matters stood. Sir A.
caused the Council of State, whereof he was a member, to be summoned,
and charged Monk that he was playing false. The General insisted that
he was true to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> his principles, and firm to what he had promised, and
that he was ready to give them all satisfaction. Sir A. told him if he
were sincere he would remove all scruples, and would instantly take
away their commissions from such and such men in the army, and appoint
others, and that before he left the room. Monk consented: a great
part of the commissions of his officers were changed; and Sir Edward
Harley, a member of the Council, and then present, was made Governor of
Dunkirk, in the room of Sir William Lockhart: the army ceased to be at
Monk's devotion: the ambassador was recalled, and broke his heart."</p>

<p>Another authority, Dr Price, one of Monk's chaplains, speaking on
the same subject, says: "His wife had in some degree prepared him to
appear, when the first opportunity should be offered. For her custom
was (when the General's and her own work and the day were ended) to
come into the dining-room in her <i>treason-gown</i>, as I called it, I
telling him that when she had that gown on he should allow her to say
anything. And, indeed, her tongue was her own then, and she would not
spare it; insomuch that I, who still chose to give my attendance at
those hours, have often shut the dining-room doors, and charged the
servants to stand without till they were called in." The same writer
also relates a remarkable dream, in which the Duchess of Albemarle
foresaw the return of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> royalty to England. "She saw," says Dr Price, "a
great crown of gold on the top of a dunghill, which a numerous company
of brave men encompassed, but for a great while none would break the
ring. At last there came a tall black man up to the dunghill, took up
the crown, and put it upon his head. Upon the relating of this, she
asked what manner of man the King was. I told her, that when I was an
Eton scholar, I saw at Windsor, sometimes, the Prince of Wales, at the
head of a company of boys; that himself was a very lovely black boy,
and that I heard that, since, he was grown very tall." Fantastic as
this dream story may appear, it is "not impossible," says Jesse, "that
England owes the restoration of royalty to this and other similarly
trifling circumstances connected with the influence which Anne Clarges
exercised over the mind of her uxorious lord. Nothing, indeed, appears
more natural, than that an ignorant and uneducated woman should have
attached an undue degree of importance to an idle dream. The duchess,
moreover, is known to have been a zealous adherent of the House of
Stuart; and lastly, it is certain that she exerted all her influence to
induce him to restore Charles the Second to the throne."</p>

<p>The Duke of Albemarle died on January 3, 1670, in his sixty-second
year. His body, after it had lain in state at Somerset House for
several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> weeks, was interred, with great pomp and ceremony, in
Westminster Abbey, on the north side of Henry the Seventh's chapel. His
wife survived him only a few days, and was buried by his side. Their
only surviving son&mdash;Christopher, who was born in 1653&mdash;succeeded to his
father's titles and enormous wealth. He died in Jamaica, where he was
Governor, in 1688, without issue.</p>

<p>But to return to the New Exchange. In Gay's <i>Trivia; or the Art of
Walking the Streets of London</i> (1716), there is an allusion to it:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>The place was on its downward path at this time. Quack doctors and
other charlatans flourished, and the most degraded of women frequented
its walks. If one may judge from contemporary advertisements, "Sir
William Read, Her Majesty's oculist in Durham Yard in the Strand," did
a large trade in the years 1709 and 1710. Thanks to his "long practice
and great experience, he has lately found out a medicine that clarifies
the eyes from suffusions and cures cataracts." He also professed to
"cure hair lips and wry necks, tho' never so deformed." Lady Read took
in hand the female customers. Their establishment was in "New Exchange
Row,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> near Durham Yard." This William Read was originally a tailor.
He became an itinerant quack, and, in 1705, was knighted for "curing"
blind sailors and soldiers without charge. Thanks to his appointment
as oculist to Queen Anne, he acquired a fortune. This empiric died in
1715. By 1737, the New Exchange had become so disreputable that it was
taken down, and a number of dwelling-houses and shops&mdash;the site of
which is indicated by the existing buildings between George Court and
Durham House Street&mdash;facing the Strand, were erected.</p>

<p>Before leaving this part of the neighbourhood, it should be observed
that at Durham Rents, which was at the back of Durham House, there was
a book-shop early in the sixteenth century, as we see by the following
announcement:&mdash;"The Myrroure of Owre Lady, Fynyshed and Imprynted in
the Suburbes of the Famous Citye of London, without Temple Barre, by me
Richard Fawkes, dwellynge in Durresme Rents, or else in Powles Church
Yard, at the Synge of the A.B.C., 1530." On December 9, 1614, Thomas
Wilson, traveller, author, and statesman, granted a lease to James
Bovy, Serjeant of the Cellar, of "the Sill House, in the Strand, near
Durham House." And, on October 1, 1618, there was recorded an indenture
of sale from "Sir Thomas Wilson, of Hertford, now residing in St
Martin-in-the-Fields, London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> of a dwelling-house, garden, etc., in
St Martin's-in-the-Fields, between Durham House, Britain's Burse, York
House, and the River, to Wm. Roo, of London, for 374." Wilson, who was
knighted in this year, was employed in obtaining admissions, that were
sufficient to condemn him, from Sir Walter Raleigh, then a prisoner
in the Tower. Twenty-eight days after the date of the indenture of
sale of Wilson's property, near Durham House, Raleigh was executed. A
year later, Sir Thomas Wilson, in a letter to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, writes from "my house in Duresme Yard," and sends a list of
ambassadors and other people residing there. Wilson, who was a man of
considerable learning, and a traveller, translated from the Spanish
the <i>Diana</i> of George de Montemayor (the Portugese poet and romance
writer, 1520-1562), the source to which Shakespeare went for several of
the incidents in <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>. He entered the service
of Robert Cecil in 1605. He was the keeper of the records at Whitehall
from 1606 to the year of his death, 1629. He is the Wilson referred as
"ye keeper of ye burse," quoted in the rules for the New Exchange in
the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>The overcrowding of the New Exchange was a source of much annoyance
to the inhabitants of Durham Yard, who made formal complaint of their
grievances. As a result, an Order in Council,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> dated May 4, 1638, was
made by the Inner Star Chamber, as follows:&mdash;"The Lords being made
acquainted that, over the New Exchange, called Britain's Burse, there
are divers families inhabiting as inmates, and that adjoining the
wall of the Court of Durham House, there are sheds employed as eating
rooms and for other uses, to the great annoyance of the inhabitants,
and danger of infection. It was ordered that the Lord Privy Seal and
Lord Newburgh, Chancellor of the Duchy, should call before them the
inhabitants of the said places, and take order for their removal, and
if they find any of the said persons obstinate should certify their
names."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a certain night in September, in the year 1768, "the
Queen's Head Alehouse, near Durham Yard in the Strand, fell down,
but the family being alarmed, happily no lives were lost." To such a
neglected state had Durham Yard and its surroundings become when, most
opportunely, two Scotch architects, the brothers Adam, arrived on the
scene of decay. All that was left of the former grandeur of Durham
House consisted of "a number of small low-lying houses, coal-sheds
and lay-stalls, washed by the muddy deposits of the Thames." The
property was then in the possession of the Duke of St Albans, from
whom the brothers Adam obtained a ninety-nine years' lease, dating
from Lady-day, 1768.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> The Duke, it seems, was in a parlous condition
when he parted with this property, for the small sum, be it said, of
1200 a year. For, in a public print of January 13, 1770, it is stated
that "the Duke of St Albans, who is now confined for debt at Brussels,
disposed some time ago of the ground in Durham Yard in which the new
square is now building; but, before the money was remitted him, he
created so many fresh debts, that it is imagined he will remain there
for life."</p>

<p>The architects effected a marvellous change over the district. By
allowing the wharves to remain, and throwing a series of arches over
the entire declivity, they "connected the river with the Strand by a
spacious archway, and over these extensive vaultings erected a series
of well-built streets, a noble terrace towards the river, and a house
with a convenient suite of rooms for the then recently established
Society of Arts." So said Peter Cunningham. Older authorities were
even more enthusiastic. That fine architectural draughtsman, Thomas
Malton, the younger (1748-1804), who was an eye-witness of the vast
change effected, praised the brothers highly, in his <i>Picturesque
Tour through London and Westminster</i>, in 1792: "To their researches
among the vestiges of antiquity," he says, "we are indebted for many
improvements in ornamental architecture, and for a style of decoration
unrivalled for elegance and gaiety, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> in spite of innovations of
fashion, will prevail as long as good taste prevails in the nation.
This judgment of the Messrs Adam, in the management of their plans, and
their care in conducting the executive part, deserves great praise;
and it must be mentioned to their honour, that no accident happened in
the progress of the work, nor has any failure been since observed&mdash;an
instance of good fortune which few architects have experienced when
struggling with similar difficulties. This remark will make a very
little impression on the careless observer who rattles along the
streets in his carriage, unconscious that below him are the streets, in
which carts and drays, and other vehicles of business, are constantly
employed in conveying coals, and various kinds of merchandise, from the
river to the consumer, or to the warehouses and avenues inaccessible
to the light of day; but he who will take the trouble to explore
these depths will feel its force; and when he perceives that all the
buildings which compose the Adelphi are in front but one building, and
that the upper streets are no more than open passages, connecting the
different parts of the superstructure, he will acknowledge that the
architects are entitled to more than common praise.</p>

<p>"The terrace is happily situated in the heart of the Metropolis,
upon a bend of the river, which presents to the right and left every
eminent object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> which characterises and adorns the cities of London
and Westminster; while its elevation lifts the eye above the wharfs
and warehouses on the opposite side of the river, and charms it with a
prospect of the adjacent country. Each of these views is so grand, so
rich, and so various, that it is difficult to determine which deserves
the preference.</p>

<p>"The manner of decorating the fronts of the shops and houses in Adam
Street is equally singular and beautiful. It may be proper here to
remark, what some future writer may dwell on with pleasure, that in
the streets of the Adelphi the brothers have contrived to preserve
their respective Christian names as well as their family name; while
by giving the general appellation of The Adelphi to this assemblage of
streets and buildings, they have converted the whole into a lasting
memorial of their friendship and fraternal co-operation.</p>

<p>"The building of the Adelphi was a project of such magnitude, and
attracted so much attention, that it must have been a period of the
utmost importance in the lives of the architects. In this work they
displayed to the public eye that practical knowledge and skill, and
that ingenuity and taste, which till then had been in a great measure
confined to private edifices, and known only by the voice of fame to
the majority of those who feel an interest in the art of building. The
extreme depth of the foundations, the massy piers of brickwork, and
the spacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> subterraneous vaults and arcades, excited the wonder of
the ignorant and the applause of the skilful; while the regularity of
the streets in the superstruction, and the elegance and novelty of the
decorations, equally astonished and delighted all sorts and conditions
of people." The brothers had to contend with many difficulties ere
they accomplished their great work. In order to embank the river, it
was necessary to obtain a special Act of Parliament (12 Geo. III., c.
34, 1771). But, the Court and the City being then at variance, the
authorities of the latter vented their spite by opposing the bill,
the Lord Mayor, as conservator of the Thames, claiming the right to
the soil of the river on behalf of the citizens. The opposition was
very strong, but it was finally defeated, thanks, in large measure,
so Walpole states, to the influence of the Crown. Much acrimony was
displayed, and the newspaper press contained many arguments, mostly in
favour of the project. A curious and interesting letter on the subject
appeared in the <i>Morning Advertiser</i> in May 1771:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir," it said, "I never was more astonished than upon reading in your
Paper the Petition of the City of London to His Majesty against his
giving the Royal Assent to the Bill for embanking the River Thames at
<i>Durham-Yard</i>, that there was not one Word in this dull Performance
against the Propriety or Utility of the Embankment. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> was the only
Ground on which the City had any Title to interfere in this Business by
Virtue of their Right of Conservancy: But I find that though this was
what they originally let out upon in their Opposition. The Proof turned
out so strong against them, and the public Utility of the Embankment,
as well as of the Wharfs at that Part of the Town, was so clearly
demonstrated both to the Lords and Commons, that the City in this last
Stage of their Opposition think proper to pass over this very material
Circumstance in Silence, and are drove to rest their Complaints upon
two Circumstances totally new and different from what they originally
opposed it upon.</p>

<p>"First, They allege that this Bill appears to be destructive of the
ancient and valuable Rights and Properties of the City of London,
enjoyed without Interruption through a Succession of many Ages;
insinuating at the same Time that they are denied an Appeal to that Law
which knows no Partialities, but strictly gives to every Man his Due.</p>

<p>"Now, Sir, this Representation, if I were inclined to use as gross
and as harsh Epithets as the City of London do, might with very great
Truth be termed extremely false; for I myself heard Mr Lee the Council
for the City of London, fairly acknowledge at the Bar of the House of

River till within these three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> Weeks; for this amazing Discovery was
fallen upon after this Bill had made a considerable Progress in the
House of Commons; and this valuable Property had passed unnoticed by
all the Magistrates of the City, as well as their Lawyers since the
Age of Henry VII. though now asserted to be enjoyed by them without
interruption since that Period: A very bold Assertion indeed after so
direct and so satisfactory a Proof of the contrary had been within
these few Days laid before the House of Lords: Yet this Assertion is
not more extraordinary than the Insinuation mentioned above; for all
the World may be convinced how groundless the latter is by having
Recourse to the Bill, in which they will find an express Clause,
reserving to the City a Liberty to try their Right at Law, and the
Value to be ascertained by a Jury: So very tender have Parliament been
in paying Attention to their Claim of Right, however frivolous and weak
it might appear to them.</p>

<p>"A few Words in the saving Clause is the Foundation of the second
weighty Complaint in the City's Petition to the King, it being
there asserted that the City insist that the Persons who apply for
Liberty to embank ought to make Satisfaction for the same; and this
Allegation is stigmatised with the severe Terms of groundless, false
and contradictory to the City public Declarations in both Houses of
Parliament. Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> the City have not been rash in making these bold
Assertions, we leave the candid Public to decide, after reading the
following Extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Extract from the Report of the New Bridge Committee, to whom the
Petition for Leave to embank Durham-Yard, &amp;c., was refer'd; which
Report is signed by Sir Robert Ladbroke, and many others of the most
respectable Citizens of London, who, reported in Favour thereof,
provided that a Clause be obtained, 'subjecting the Ground taken
out of the River with the yearly Payment of a Farthing, a Square
superficial Foot, redeemable on Payment of twenty years Purchase, and
for appropriating the Quit Rent and Purchase Money to the Fund created
by Parliament for repairing, lighting, and watching the Bridge.'</p>

<p>"Extract from the Case of the City of London printed by them, and
handed about to the Members of the House of Commons. At the second
reading of the Embanking Bill, which concludes thus: 'However a Bill
is now brought in to embank the River, and to vest in the Owners of
the adjoining Houses the Soil to be embanked not only against the
Representation of the City of London, the Conservators of the River,
but without any Regard to their Claim or Right to the Soil to be
embanked, and a Property of immense Value to be taken from the Public
without any Consideration': And this was the general Language held by
the few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> Advocates for the City in the House of Commons, until a new
Doctrine was broached by Mr Dunning, who discovered that this valuable
Property could not be estimated by any Jury at above Five Shillings
Value; and to this last Doctrine the Party have since adhered; for
Lord Camden, in his Speech to the Lords, declared, that no Jury could
value the Soil embanked at one Farthing; and these great Lawyers are
entirely right; for by the Usage of the River, the Proprietor of every
Wharf has an exclusive Right of Frontage or Water-way to Low-water
Mark. Therefore whether the King or the City are the Proprietors of the
Soil, neither the one or the other could have embanked to the Exclusion
of the Proprietors of the adjoining Wharfs; for in this Event no Wharf
upon the River Thames would be of the smallest Value; consequently no
Persons whatever could have made any advantage of this Embankment but
the Parties to the Bill. If this requires any Confirmation, the Bill
obtained by the City for the Embankment at Blackfriars establishes it
beyond a Doubt, for that Bill vests the Ground obtained off the River
in the Proprietors of the adjoining Wharfs and Houses.</p>

<p>"When this is thoroughly understood, how ridiculous must the City
appear, and how much do they degrade themselves, by carrying a
Petition to the Throne, after having squandered their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> Treasure in an
Opposition, the Object of which is to acquire a Property not worth one
Farthing to them; setting up an ostentatious Parade of an Infringement
of that Property which they knew they have no Right to, and if they
had ought undoubtedly to be given a public Use, upon having a proper
Compensation allowed them for it, which is done every Day in Cases of
Roads, Navigations, and other Improvements of public Utility, even
where private Individuals are to be the principal Benefactors.</p>

<p>"A great City ought not to act the Part of the Dog in the Manger, but
should encourage every Scheme of public Advantage. These formerly have
been the Sentiments of the City of London, when that City was under
the Guidance of grave, respectable and wise Magistrates, not heated by
Party, or misguided by violent or factious Views." The storm raised by
the projected building drew from Granville Sharp, the philanthropist,
a curious, but extremely dry, pamphlet entitled <i>Remarks Concerning
the Encroachments of the River Thames near Durham Yard</i>. It was dated
from the Old Jewry, August 10, 1771, but it was too late to be of any
service, for the Act allowing the embankment of the river had been
passed.</p>

<p>Even then misfortune dogged the footsteps of the courageous brothers,
for they became involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> in financial difficulties, and eventually
had to complete their buildings by raising money by means of a public
lottery. Some of these difficulties were alluded to by sympathetic
friends in the press. "The Adelphi buildings," one of them hears, "were
mortgaged for a loan of 70,000 previous to the late unhappy failures
of the banks, and it is said that the Messrs Adam had laid out as much
more upon them; so that, in the course of five years, these gentlemen
expended 140,000 to raise palaces upon an offensive heap of mud, and
circulated an immense sum to make a palpable nuisance a principal
ornament to the metropolis." Another defender wrote in a similar
strain: "Within a space of time, incredibly short for so magnificent
an undertaking, they have raised a pile of elegant buildings, noble,
convenient, and splendid, on a spot which was, two or three years
since, a mere dunghill, a receptacle for filth, obscenity, and
wretchedness, a scandal to a well-governed city and a disgrace to one
of the noblest rivers in Europe."</p>

<p>Thanks, perhaps, to the publicity thus afforded them in the public
press, the brothers Adam obtained the necessary Act of Parliament
(13 Geo. III., cap. 75, 1773) for the disposal of the property by
lottery. It was as follows:&mdash;"An Act for enabling John, Robert, James
and William Adam to dispose of several houses and buildings in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
parishes of St Martin-in-the-Fields and St Mary-le-Bow, in the county
of Middlesex, and other their effects by way of chance in such manner
as may be most for the benefit of themselves and creditors."</p>

<p>There were 4370 tickets at 50, making 218,500. The prizes numbered
108, and were thus arranged:&mdash;</p>

<p>The above facts are taken from a rare pamphlet, entitled <i>Particulars
composing the Prizes in the Adelphi Lottery</i>, published by the Adams
on January 18, 1774, in which it is stated that, "as the Messrs Adam
engaged in this undertaking, more from an enthusiasm of their own art
than from a view of profit; at the same time being eager to point out
a way to public utility, though even at an extraordinary expence;
they will be perfectly satisfied if they should only draw, from this
lottery, the money laid out by them on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> work which, they readily
confess, they have found to be too great for their private fortunes....
The Messrs Adam have thought it unnecessary to give so particular a
description of the houses in the Adelphi as they have done of the
houses in Queen Anne Street and Mansfield Street, as these buildings
are so generally known by persons who reside in town; but for the
information of those who live in the country, it may be satisfactory to
say, that they are remarkably strong and substantial and finished in
the most elegant and complete manner, much beyond the common stile of
London houses: they have all a double tier of offices, which gives an
uncommon convenience for the servants of the family.... The inhabitants
of the Adelphi buildings express the greatest satisfaction, not only
with regard to their houses, but with their situation, which is
remarkably dry, healthy and well-aired.</p>

<p>"The principal houses in the Adelphi possess not only a superior degree
of convenience, in water laid in, from the top to the bottom of each
house, but the whole buildings have also an additional safety against
fire, much beyond any other houses in London. For, besides the use of
fire engines, which they have in common with other houses, there is a
water tower erected by the Messrs Adam, which communicates with the
river Thames; and the pipes are so constructed, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> upon a minute's
notice, three engines, constantly supplied with water, can be played
upon any house in the buildings."</p>

<p>In addition to the house property enumerated, pictures and drawings by
Teniers, P. Veronese, and Guercino, together with several statues, were
enumerated in the lottery paper, so that it appears that the Adams had
been compelled to put nearly everything they possessed into the fund
for the building of the Adelphi. Fortunately they were in such favour
at Court that they were able to obtain the necessary permission for the
lottery, otherwise they would have been ruined financially over the
speculation.</p>

<p>On Thursday, March 3, 1774, the drawing up of the lottery began at the
great room, formerly Jonathan's Coffee House, in Exchange Alley, when
No. 3599 was drawn a blank, but being the first drawn ticket it was
entitled to 5000. Nine other prizes were drawn on Friday, and at this
rate the drawing continued for some time. The newspapers of the period
were full of information and advertisements respecting the lottery; and
the art of advertising appears to have been very thoroughly mastered
at that time. Tickets were sold in all parts of the town, as well as
at the Messrs Adams' office in Robert Street; intending purchasers
were told that there was a great demand and that early application was
necessary&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> in fact, that the demand began to be prodigious. Then
they were informed that "Messrs Adam propose to keep their office in
the Adelphi open till twelve o'clock on Wednesday night next (March
9) for the sale of tickets at 50 each, after which the price of the
small quantity remaining in the market must be considerably raised,
on account of the consumption of tickets by the wheel." Portions of
tickets were sold at the various lottery offices thus&mdash;a half cost
25, 5s.; a thirty-second, 1, 13s.; and a sixty-fourth, 17s. Then
there are little bits of gossip in the papers, intended to whet the
appetite of the public. Thus we are told that No. 3599, the first drawn
ticket, entitled to an estate of the value of 5000, was sold by Messrs
Richardson and Goodenough not half an hour before the lottery began
drawing, and, what is very remarkable, was the only ticket they had
left unsold. Soon afterwards, the winner of this ticket disposed of it
by auction.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the prizes were not instantly realizable, for
the buildings were to be divided among the prize-holders, and the
houses were not yet finished. Those who could not wait for their money
sold their prizes by auction, and it may be presumed that in course
of time the tickets got into a few hands.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The following is the
explanation by the Adams of their action:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Messrs Adam having received a letter signed A.B.C., which the
writer says is sent to be inserted in the public papers, requiring
to know the state of the mortgages on the buildings which constitute
the Adelphi lottery, and also what security the public have for their
completing the unfinished buildings? In answer to these questions, the
Messrs Adam, desirous to satisfy the adventurers in the lottery, and
the public in all reasonable demands, think it necessary to inform them
that the mortgagees have already been paid one half of their money, but
as it is requisite that they should join in assigning the prizes to
the fortunate adventurers, they defer paying the other half till such
assignments are completed. The Messrs Adam, ever since the obtaining
of the Act for their lottery, have proceeded with an amazing rapidity
in finishing their houses, in the same substantial manner with those
formerly finished and sold in the Adelphi; they are happy to think the
whole will be completed, and ready to be assigned, by the time they
have ascertained in their scheme and allotment, as no attention and no
expense shall be spared for that purpose."</p>

<p>Before proceeding further with the history of the Adelphi, the
indomitable brothers themselves call for notice. Robert Adam
(1728-1792) was the most noted of the four brothers&mdash;John, Robert,
James, and William. Their father, William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> Adam, of Maryburgh, N.B.
(died June 24, 1748), was the architect of Hopetoun House, and the
Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, in which city he held the appointment
of King's Mason. Robert, the second son, was born at Kirkcaldy, and
educated at Edinburgh University. Here he became on friendly terms
with several fellow students who also attained fame, including David
Hume, Dr William Robertson (the historian), Adam Smith (the political
economist), and Adam Ferguson (the philosopher). In his twenty-sixth
year Robert Adam visited Italy in the company of Clrisseau, a French
architect, and made a minute study of the ruins of the Emperor
Diocletian's palace at Spalatro, in Venetian Dalmatia. The journal of
his tour was printed in the <i>Library of the Fine Arts</i>, and, in 1764,
he published a folio volume with numerous engravings by Bartolozzi and
others, from his drawings of the palace. In this important work he
states that his object in selecting this ruin for special examination
was its residential character, as the knowledge of classical
architecture in England was derived exclusively from the remains of
public buildings. During his absence on the Continent, he was elected
F.R.S. and F.S.A. Soon after his return, he was appointed architect to
George III. This office he was obliged to resign in 1768, when he was
elected to Parliament as member for Kinross-shire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>The date of Robert Adam's return to England is generally understood to
be 1762, but the architect himself makes mention of some work "done
since my return to England in 1758." The mistake has probably arisen
from the fact that James Adam did not leave his architectural studies
in Italy until the former year. Robert, it is certain, is solely
responsible for the screen of the Admiralty buildings in Whitehall,
built in 1760. "The Admiralty," says Horace Walpole, "is a most ugly
device, and deservedly veiled by Mr Adam's handsome screen." About this
time there was a pacific invasion of England by the Scots, art being
represented by William Chambers, Allan Ramsay&mdash;son of the poet&mdash;who,
in Walpole's opinion, excelled Reynolds as a painter of women, Robert
Strange, and the Adam brothers, Robert and James. Mr Clouston doubts
the statement that Clrisseau accompanied Robert Adam to Italy. The
young French architect was famous at the time of Adam's visit to the
Continent, "and one of his pupils, Sir W. Chambers, was making a name
in England. It is not altogether evident, therefore, how, a year later,
he should have accompanied Adam to Spalatro in the subordinate position
of assistant. Still, if any man had the capability of turning a master
into a pupil through sheer force of character and magnetic presence, it
must be admitted that that man was Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> Adam. His belief in himself
was so colossal as probably to approach conceit. The very fact that,
as a young man of twenty-nine, who had already had a most expensive
education, he spent a considerable amount of his patrimony in a costly
expedition, with the view of publishing a book which could not be
expected to pay, is enough to show us something of the character of the
man.</p>

<p>"He had made up his mind that he was to take the world by storm, and
he proceeded to do so with the most absolute confidence, in spite of
disadvantages of which he must have been, at least partially, aware.</p>

<p>"In his day in Scotland, and, indeed, for long after, the speech of
even the most educated was as a foreign language to English ears.
Anything 'Englishy' in accent was ridiculed. So much was this the case
that when, towards the end of the century, certain Scottish advocates,
who found their accent a serious drawback when arguing before the House
of Lords, employed an 'English master,' the movement was laughed out of
existence.</p>

<p>"Adam may have been able to speak fairly fluently in both French and
Italian: but if his ordinary mode of speech was, as it must have
been, broad Fifeshire with a top-dressing of Midlothian, it could not
have constituted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> best introduction to London society. Yet from
the first he was both a social and a professional success, and his
immediate reception, despite his Scotch speech and his new gospel, says
more for the immense power and personality of the man than any number
of words. Other men, even greater than he, have had both reverses and
doubts about themselves. Adam had neither. He was born to succeed,
and he knew it. Even his book on the Palace at Spalatro, instead of
being an expensive way of bringing him before the public, was a great
commercial success."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Thanks to their building of Lansdowne House for the Earl of Bute,
and Caen Wood House, Hampstead, for Lord Mansfield, as well as to
the fame which they obtained by the Adelphi, Robert and James Adam
acquired a great reputation as classical architects, and they enjoyed
the patronage of the aristocracy. Amongst the most important of their
other works were Luton House in Bedfordshire; Osterley House, near
Brentford; Keddlestone, Derbyshire; Compton Verney, Warwickshire; the
screen fronting the high road, and extensive internal alterations of
Sion or Syon House, Middlesex, the seat of the Duke of Northumberland;
the infirmary of Glasgow; the parish church at Mistley, Essex; the
Register House,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> Edinburgh; and the Admiralty screen. The number and
importance of their buildings in the metropolis materially influenced
and much improved the street architecture of London. They originated
the idea of giving to a number of unimportant private edifices the
appearance of one imposing structure. Portland, Stratford, and Hamilton
Places, and the south and east sides of Fitzroy Square, are instances
of the manner in which they carried this principle into effect. "An
innovation of more doubtful service," according to the <i>Dictionary of
National Biography</i>, "was their use of stucco in facing brick houses.
Their right to the exclusive use of a composition patented by Liardet,
a Frenchman, was the subject of two law-suits, which they gained."</p>

<p>James Fergusson, in his <i>History of Architecture</i>, places their
knowledge of classical art below that of Sir William Chambers. He adds:
"Their great merit&mdash;if merit it be&mdash;is that they stamped their works
with a certain amount of originality, which, had it been of a better
quality, might have done something to emancipate art from its trammels.
The principal characteristic of their style was the introduction of
very large windows, generally without dressings. These they frequently
attempted to group, three or more together, by a great glazed arch
over them, so as to try and make the whole side of a house look like
one room."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> Mr Fergusson thinks the college at Edinburgh the best of
their works, and says: "We possess few public buildings presenting so
truthful and well-balanced a design as this."</p>

<p>Whatever were the architectural defects of their works, the brothers
formed a style, which was marked especially in their interiors by a
fine sense of proportion, and a very elegant taste in the selection and
disposition of niches, lunettes, reliefs, festoons, and other classical
ornaments. It was their custom to design furniture in character with
their apartments, and their works of this kind are still greatly
prized. Amongst them may be specially mentioned their side-boards with
elegant urn-shaped knife-boxes, but they also designed bookcases and
brackets, pedestals and cabinets, clock-cases and candelabra, mirror
frames and console tables, of singular and original merit, adapting
classical forms to modern uses with a success unrivalled by any other
designers of furniture in England. They designed, also, carriages and
plate, and a sedan chair for Queen Charlotte. Of their decorative
work generally it may be said that it was rich but neat, refined but
not effeminate, chaste but not severe, and that it will probably have
quite as lasting and beneficial effect upon English taste as their
architectural structures.</p>

<p>In 1773, the brothers Robert and James commenced the publication of
their <i>Works on Archi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>tecture</i>, in folio parts, which was continued
at intervals till 1778, and reached the end of the second volume. In
1822, the work was completed by the posthumous publication of a third
volume, but the three bound up together do not make a thick book.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Robert Adam also obtained some reputation as a landscape painter. As
an architect, he was extensively employed to the last. In the year
preceding his death he designed no less than eight public works and
twenty-five private buildings. He died at his house in Albemarle
Street, from the bursting of a blood-vessel in his stomach, on March
3, 1792. Of the social position he attained, and the estimation in
which he was held, no greater proof can be afforded than the record
of his funeral in Westminster Abbey. His pall-bearers were the Duke
of Buccleuch, the Earl of Coventry, the Earl of Lauderdale, Viscount
Stormont, Lord Frederick Campbell, and Richard Pulteney (the botanist).</p>

<p>His younger brother, James, died in the same street, on October 20, two
years later, from apoplexy. His work was so closely connected with that
of Robert as to be practically undistinguishable. It is thought, by
many, that he was solely responsible for the design of Portland Place.
At one time he was architect to George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> III., and was master mason to
the Board of Ordnance in North Britain. He published <i>Practical Essays
on Architecture</i>, and, at the time of his death, he was engaged on
a history of architecture. The eldest brother, John, inherited the
business of the father, and remained in Scotland. William Adam is said
to have died in 1748, in which case he could hardly have "assisted his
brother Robert in building the Adelphi" (<i>Dict. of Nat. Biography</i>).</p>

<p>And Walpole, writing to Mason on July 29, 1773, says: "What are the
Adelphi Buildings? Warehouses, laced down the seams, like a soldier's
frill in a regimental old coat." Yet the author of <i>The Castle of
Otranto</i> did not disdain from asking Robert Adam to design a room for
him.</p>

<p>Apart from their financial troubles in building the Adelphi, the Adams
brothers had to stand much banter. It was said, with what truth I know
not, that they obtained their workmen, "with true patriotism," from
Scotland, and that the labours of the artisans were stimulated by
countless bagpipes; "but the canny men, finding the bagpipes played
their tunes rather too quick, threw up the work, and Irishmen were then
employed." In the <i>Foundling Hospital for Wit</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the nationality of
the architects is rudely assailed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inseparably</span> connected with the romance of the Adelphi, and
very interesting on its own account, is the history of the Society
of Arts, with its memories, not only of painters, but of Johnson and
other celebrities. The Society owes its origin to William Shipley
(1714-1803), a drawing-master of Northampton, and brother of Jonathan
Shipley, Bishop of St Asaph, the friend of Benjamin Franklin. It
was established at a meeting held on March 22, 1754, at Rawthmell's
Coffee-house, in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. Its first president
was Jacob, Lord Viscount Folkestone. Its complete designation is "The
Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce."
Smollett, in his <i>History of England</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> (1757), says, somewhat
grandiloquently: "The Society is so numerous, the contributions
so considerable, the plan so judiciously laid, and executed with
such discretion and spirit as to promise much more effectual and
extensive advantage to the public than ever accrued from all the
boasted academies of Christendom." The Society had various homes
prior to settling in the Adelphi. Its first meetings were held over a
circulating library in Crane's Court, Fleet Street. A move was made
westward to Craig's Court, Charing Cross, and from there the Society
went to the Strand, in rooms opposite the New Exchange, and, in 1759,
to apartments in Beaufort Buildings, Savoy.</p>

<p>In 1771, the brothers Adam entered into an agreement with the Society
for the erection of "a proper building in the Adelphi for the use
of the Society and the accommodation of its officers." The first
stone was laid by Lord Romney, on March 28, 1772, and the building
was opened in 1774. The Great Room, in which are the six famous
pictures painted by James Barry, R.A. (1741-1806), between the years
1777 and 1783, is 44 feet in width, 60 feet in depth, and 48 feet in
height. The painting of these celebrated pictures is one of the most
extraordinary episodes in the history of art. In 1774, the Society of
Arts suggested to certain members of the Royal Academy&mdash;then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> newly
instituted&mdash;that they should paint the interior of the Great Room,
and that they should be reimbursed by the public exhibition of the
completed works. This proposition was rejected by the academicians, at
whose head was Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Barry, as a member, refused the
offer. Three years later, however, Barry, having but sixteen shillings
in his pocket, applied for permission to execute the work, unaided,
and without remuneration. The Society's housekeeper told Benjamin
Haydon, the historical painter (1786-1846), that she remembered Barry
at work on his frescoes. His violence, she said, was dreadful, his
oaths were horrid, and his temper was like insanity. In summer, he
started painting at five o'clock, worked until dark, and then etched by
lamp-light until eleven at night. Burke and Johnson called once. But no
artist dared to brave his wrath. He had his tea boiled in a quart pot,
dined on porridge, and drank milk for supper. So poor was the painter
that he applied, but in vain, to the Society for a little money, and
"an insolent secretary even objected to his charge for colours and
models." Subsequently, the Society relented and advanced the artist
a hundred pounds. The Society "afterwards indulged him with two
exhibitions of his paintings, in 1783 and 1784, which brought him 503,
12s., the Society paying the cost of the exhibitions, which amounted
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> 174." He was also "rewarded" by the Society with a gold medal. But
he had other, and, perhaps, more pleasing recognitions of his talent.
That sturdy traveller and philanthropist, Jonas Hanway (1712-1786),
came to one of the exhibitions, and the pioneer of the umbrella was so
pleased that he insisted upon leaving a guinea instead of the customary
shilling. The Prince of Wales gave Barry sittings, and Lord Aldborough
declared that the painter had "surpassed Raphael." Lord Romney gave
him a hundred guineas for a copy of the heads, and Dr Johnson thought
highly of Barry's imaginative powers. "Whatever the hand may have
done," he said to Boswell, "the mind has done its part. There is a
grasp of mind there which you find nowhere else." Poor, neglected, and
half-mad, Barry died at the age of sixty-five. His body lay in state in
the Great Room on March 7. He was buried in St Paul's.</p>

<p>Some sixty years ago, said a writer towards the middle of the last
century, there might have been seen daily passing in a direction
between Oxford Street and the Adelphi, for years together, and
through all kinds of weather, one whose appearance told, to even the
most casual observer, he looked upon a remarkable man. Referring to
himself, in one of his letters to a friend, Barry had once said,
"Though the body and the soul of a picture will discover themselves
on the slightest glance, yet you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> know it could not be the same with
such a pock-fretted, hard-featured little fellow as I am also"; but
neither these personal characteristics, nor the mean garb in which
he usually appeared, could conceal the earnestness stamped upon his
grave, saturnine countenance, or the air of entire absorption in
some mental pursuit, having little in common with the bustle of the
everyday business of the world around him. He was a man to make or to
keep few friends, and to shun all acquaintances; it was not often,
therefore, that, in these passages to and fro, he had any companion;
but the event was noticeable when he had, from the striking change in
his demeanour. He became full of animation, and of a kind of sparkling
cheerfulness; his conversation was at once frank, weighty, and
elevating, and even the oaths, with which he made somewhat free, could
not spoil the delight of the most fastidious censor of words, whilst
borne along on the full and free current of the painter's thoughts.
No one but himself at such times would have called his countenance
"hard-featured"; its smile was inexpressibly sweet, its look of scorn
or anger, when roused, such as few men could have met unmoved. But
what was the employment that thus determined for so long a period his
daily movements? The answer will require a brief review of his past
career. Whilst a young student at Rome, Barry, annoyed by the absurd
taunts of foreigners as to the un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>genial character of the British
soil for the growth of art, was often seduced into answering them in
such a manner as suited rather his fiery temper and indomitable will
than the cause which he so impatiently espoused. But a better result
was his own quiet determination to devote his life to the disproof
of the theory. He began admirably, by a strict analysis of his own
powers, and by inquiring how they were best to be developed. Here is
the result: "If I should chance to have genius, or anything else," he
observes, in a letter to a friend, "it is so much the better; but my
hopes are grounded upon an unwearied, intense application, of which
I am not sparing. At present I have little to show that I value; my
work is all underground digging and laying foundations, which, with
God's assistance, I may hereafter find the use of. I every day centre
more and more upon the art; I give myself totally to it; and except
honour and conscience, am determined to renounce everything else." But
the writer was without a shilling in the world to call his own; and
although he had friends, the best of friends, as they were&mdash;one of them
at least, Burke, the best of men&mdash;he had already received from them
the entire means of subsistence while he had been studying so long at
Rome, and was determined, therefore, to be no longer a burden to them
or to others; but how should he, renouncing all ordinary blandishments
of a young painter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> career, the "face-painting" and other methods by
which genius condescends to become fashionable, or, in other words,
to lay down its immortality for the pleasure of being acknowledged
immortal&mdash;how was he to subsist? It was whilst this question remained,
we may suppose, not decisively answered, that the painter thus wrote
to another friend:&mdash;"O, I could be happy, in my going home, to find
some corner where I could sit down in the middle of my studies, books,
and casts after the antique, to paint this work and others, where I
might have models of nature, when necessary, bread and soup, and a
coat to cover me! I should care not what became of my work when it
was done; but I reflect with horror upon such a fellow as I am, and
with such a kind of art in London, with house-rent to pay, duns to
follow me, and employers to look for. Had I studied art in a manner
more accommodated to the nation, there would be no dread of this." But
from this state of despondency and dissatisfaction he was soon to rise
triumphant. Again and again he asked himself how he was to subsist
while the great things he meditated should be accomplished, and the
answer came: the conclusion was anything but attractive or cheering,
but he saw it was the conclusion: no cross, no crown; and he accepted
it ungrudgingly. It was not long before he could say, "I have taken
great pains to fashion myself to this kind of Quixotism; to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> end I
have contracted and simplified my cravings and wants, and brought them
into a very narrow compass." There are few, we think, of those who may
have smiled with pity or contempt at the painter's mean garb, who would
not have honoured it while they reverenced him, had they known this.
The first apparent opportunity of achieving the object indicated was in
connection with the proposed decoration of St Paul's.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But this fell
through, and it was not until the Society of Arts accepted his offer
that he was able to bring himself into line with his own convictions.</p>

<p class="caption">THE STRAND ENTRANCE TO DURHAM YARD.</p>

<p>"Let us now ascend the stairs to the first floor, passing through the
little ante-room where the alto-relievos of Bacon and Nollekens are
mounted high upon the walls, and beneath the portrait of the founder
of the Society, which appropriately hangs over the door of the great
room, where the painter's works are to be found. The first glance shows
us in one way the magnitude of the undertaking; the upper portion
of the walls of the whole of the noble room, or hall, as it should
rather be called, is covered by the six paintings of which the series
consists; as we step from one to another, we perceive that these large
spaces have been wrought upon in a large spirit; and a still closer
examination opens to our view, pictures of surpassing beauty and
grandeur, and scarcely less remarkable as a whole for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> successful
manner in which they have been executed than for the daring originality
of their conception."</p>

<p>Barry's six pictures for the Society of Arts were designed on dignified
and important subjects, so connected as to illustrate this great
maxim of moral truth: "That the attainment of happiness, individual
as well as public, depends on the development, proper cultivation,
and perfection of the human faculties, physical and moral, which are
as well calculated to lead human nature to its true rank and the
glorious designation assigned for it by Providence." To illustrate this
doctrine, the first picture exhibits mankind in a savage state, exposed
to all the inconvenience and misery of neglected culture; the second
represents a Harvest Home, or thanksgiving, to Ceres and Bacchus; the
third, the victors at Olympia; the fourth, Navigation, or the Triumph
of the Thames; the fifth, the Distribution of Rewards by the Society;
and the sixth, Elysium, or the state of final Retribution. Three of
these subjects are truly poetical, the others historical. The pictures
are all of the same height, viz., eleven feet ten inches; and the
first, second, fourth, and fifth are fifteen feet two inches long; the
third and sixth, which occupy the whole breadth of the room, at the
north and south ends, are each forty-two feet long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Thames.</i>&mdash;Personified and represented, of a venerable, majestic
and gracious aspect, sitting on the waters in a triumphal car, steering
himself with one hand, and holding in the other the mariner's compass.
The car is borne along by our great navigators, Sir Francis Drake,
Sir Walter Raleigh, Sebastian Cabot, and the late Captain Cook. In
the front of the car, and apparently in the action of meeting it,
are four figures, representing Europe, Asia, Africa, and America,
ready to lay their several productions in the lap of the Thames. The
supplicating action of the poor negro slave&mdash;or, more properly, of
enslaved Africa&mdash;the cord round his neck, the tear on his cheek, the
iron manacles and attached heavy chain on his wrists, with his hands
clasped and stretched out for mercy, denote the agonies of his soul,
and the feelings of the artist thus expressed, before the abolition
of slavery became the subject of public investigation. Overhead is
Mercury, the emblem of commerce, summoning the nations all together;
and following the car are Nereids carrying several articles of the
principal manufactures of Great Britain. In this scene of triumph and
joy the artist has introduced music, and, for this reason, placed
among the sea-nymphs his friend, Dr Burney. In the distance is a view
of the chalky cliffs on the English coast, with ships sailing, highly
characteristic of the commerce of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> country, which the picture
is intended to record. In the end of this picture, next the chimney,
there is a naval pillar, mausoleum, observatory, light-house, or all of
these, they being all comprehended in the same structure.</p>

<p>In this important object, so ingeniously produced by the sea-gods,
we have at last obtained the happy concurrence and union of so many
important desiderata in that opportunity of convenient inspection of
all the sculptured communications, the want of which had been so deeply
regretted by all who had seen the Trajan and Antonine columns, and
other celebrated remains of antiquity.</p>

<p><i>The Society.</i>&mdash;This picture represents the distribution of the Rewards
of the Society. Not far advanced from the left side of the picture
stands the late Lord Romney, then president of the Society, habited in
the robes of his dignity: near the president stands His Royal Highness
the Prince of Wales; and sitting at the corner of the picture, holding
in his hand the instrument of the institution, is Mr William Shipley,
"whose public spirit gave rise to this Society." One of the farmers,
who are producing specimens of grain to the president, is Arthur Young,
Esq. Near him Mr More, the late secretary. On the right hand of the
late Lord Romney stands the present Earl of Romney, then V.P., and on
the left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> late Owen Salusbury Brereton, Esq., V.P.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Towards the
centre of the picture is seen that distinguished example of female
excellence, Mrs Montague, who long honoured the Society with her name
and subscription. She appears recommending the ingenuity and industry
of a young female, whose work she is producing. Near her are placed the
late Duchess of Northumberland; the present Duke of Northumberland,
V.P.; the late Joshua Steele, Esq., V.P.; Dr Hurd, Bishop of Worcester;
Soame Jennings and James Harris, Esqrs.; and the two duchesses of
Rutland and Devonshire. Between these ladies, the late Dr Samuel
Johnson seems pointing out the example of Mrs Montague to their Graces'
attention and imitation. Further advanced is His Grace the late Duke
of Richmond, V.P., and the late Edmund Burke, Esq. Still nearer the
right-hand side of the picture is the late Edward Hooper, Esq., V.P.,
and the late Keane Fitzgerald, Esqrs., V.P.; His Grace the late Duke
of Northumberland, V.P.; the Earl of Radnor, V.P., William Lock,
Esq., and Dr William Hunter are examining some drawings by a youth,
to whom a premium has been adjudged: behind him is another youth,
in whose countenance the dejection he feels at being disappointed
in his expectation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> of a reward is finely expressed. Near the right
side of the piece are seen the late Lord Viscount Folkestone, first
president of this Society; his son, the late Earl Radnor, V.P.; and Dr
Stephen Hales, V.P. In the background appear part of the water-front
of Somerset House, St Paul's, and other objects in the vicinity and
view of this Society, as instituted at London. And as a very large
part of the rewards bestowed by the Society have been distributed to
promote the polite arts of painting and sculpture, the artist has also
most judiciously introduced a picture and statue. The subject of the
picture is the Fall of Lucifer, designed by Mr Barry, when the Royal
Academy had selected six of the members to paint pictures for St Paul's
Cathedral; the statue is that of the Grecian mother dying, and in those
moments attentive only to the safety of her child. In the corners of
the picture are represented many articles which have been invented or
improved by the encouragement of this Society. In the lower corner
of this picture, next the chimney, are introduced two large models
intended by Mr Barry as improvements of medals and coins.</p>

</p>
<p class="caption"> IVY LANE, STRAND (THE BOUNDARY OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER
AND THE CITY OF WESTMINSTER).</p>

<p><i>Elysium, or the State of Final Retribution.</i>&mdash;In this sublime picture,
which occupies the whole length of the room, the artist has, with
wonderful sagacity, and without any of those anachronisms which tarnish
the lustre of other very celebrated per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>formances, brought together
those great and good men of all ages and nations, who have acted as the
cultivators and benefactors of mankind. This picture is separated from
that of the Society distributing its rewards by palm trees; near which,
on a pedestal, sits a pelican, feeding its young with its own blood, a
happy type of those personages represented in the picture, who had worn
themselves out in the service of mankind. Behind the palms, near the
top of the picture, are indistinctly seen, as immersed and lost in a
great blaze of light, cherubims veiled with their wings, in the act of
adoration, and offering incense to that invisible and incomprehensible
Power which is above them, and out of the picture, from whence the
light and glory proceed and are diffused over the whole piece. By thus
introducing the idea of the Divine essence, by effect rather than by
form, the absurdity committed by many painters is happily avoided,
and the mind of every intelligent spectator is filled with awe and
reverence.</p>

<p>The groups of female figures, which appear at a further distance
absorbed in glory, are those characters of female excellence, whose
social conduct, benevolence, affectionate friendship, and regular
discharge of domestic duties, soften the cares of human life, and
diffuse happiness around them. In the more advanced part, just
bordering on the blaze of light (where the female figures are almost
absorbed) is introduced a group of poor native West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> Indian females, in
the act of adoration, preceded by angels, burning incense, and followed
by their good bishop, his face partly concealed by that energetic hand
which holds his crozier, or pastoral staff&mdash;who may, notwithstanding
the word Chiapa, inscribed on the front of his mitre, be identified
with the glorious friar Bartolomeo de las Casas, bishop of that place.
This matter of friendly intercourse, continued beyond life, is pushed
still further in the more advanced part of the same group by the male
adoring Americans and some Dominican friars, where the very graceful
incident occurs of one of these Dominicans directing the attention of
an astonished Caribb to some circumstance of beatitude, the enjoyment
of which he had promised to his Caribb friend. The group below on
the left hand in this picture consists of Roger Bacon, Archimedes,
Descartes, and Thales; behind them stand Sir Francis Bacon, Copernicus,
Galileo, and Sir Isaac Newton, regarding with awe and admiration a
solar system, which two angels are unveiling and explaining to them.
Near the inferior angel, who is holding the veil, is Columbus, with a
chart of his voyage; and close to him Epaminondas, with his shield;
Socrates, Cato the younger, the elder Brutus, and Sir Thomas More; a
sextumbriate to which, Swift says, all ages have not been able to add
a seventh. Behind Marcus Brutus is William Molyneux, holding his book
of the case of Ireland; near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> Columbus is Lord Shaftesbury, John Locke,
Zeno, Aristotle, and Plato; and, in the opening between this group and
the next, are Sir William Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation of
the blood, and the honourable Robert Boyle.</p>

<p>The next group are legislators, where King Alfred the Great is leaning
on the shoulder of William Penn, who is showing his tolerant, pacific
code of equal laws to Lycurgus. Standing around them are Minos,
Trajan, Antoninus, Peter the Great of Russia, Edward the Black Prince,
Henry the Fourth of France, and Andrea Doria of Genoa. Here, too,
are introduced those patrons of genius, Lorenzo de Medici, Louis the
Fourteenth, Alexander the Great, Charles the First, Colbert, Leo the
Tenth, Francis the First, the Earl of Arundel, and the illustrious
monk Cassiodorus, no less admirable and exemplary as the secretary
of state than as the friar in his convent at Viviers, the plan of
which he holds in his hand. Just before this group, on the rocks
which separate Elysium from the infernal regions, are placed the
Angelic Guards; and in the most advanced part an archangel, weighing
attentively the virtues and vices of mankind, whose raised hand and
expressive countenance denote great concern at the preponderancy of
evil. Behind this figure is another angel, explaining to Pascal and
Bishop Butler the analogy between Nature and revealed Religion. The
figure behind Pascal and Butler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> with his arms stretched out, and
advancing with so much energy, is that ornament of our latter age, the
graceful, the sublime Bossuet, Bishop of Meux. The uniting tendency of
the paper he holds in that hand, resting on the shoulder of Origen,
would well comport with those pacific views of the amiable Grotius, for
healing those discordant evils which are sapping the foundations of
Christianity amongst the nations of Europe, where in other respects it
would be, and even is, so happily and so well established.</p>

<p>Behind Francis the First and Lord Arundel are Hugo Grotius, Father
Paul, and Pope Adrian. Towards the top of the picture, and near the
centre, sits Homer; on his right hand, Milton; next him, Shakespeare,
Spenser, Chaucer, and Sappho. Behind Sappho sits Alcus, who is
talking with Ossian; near him are Menander, Molire, Congreve, Bruma,
Confucius, Mango Capac, etc. etc. Next Homer, on the other side, is
Archbishop Fenelon, with Virgil leaning on his shoulder; and near them
are Tasso, Ariosto, and Dante. Behind Dante, Petrarca, Laura, Giovanni,
and Boccaccio.</p>

<p>In the second range of figures, over Edward the Black Prince and Peter
the Great, are Swift, Erasmus, Cervantes; near them Pope, Dryden,
Addison, Richardson, Moses Mendelssohn, and Hogarth. Behind Dryden and
Pope are Sterne, Gray, Goldsmith, Thomson, and Fielding; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> near
Richardson, Inigo Jones, Sir Christopher Wren, Sir Joshua Reynolds,
and Vandyke. Next Vandyke is Rubens, with his hand on the shoulders of
Le S&oelig;ur, and behind him is Le Brun: next to these are Julio Romano,
Dominichino, and Annibal Caracci, who are in conversation with Phidias;
behind whom is Giles Hussey. Nicholas Poussin and the Sicyonian maid
are near them, with Callimachus and Pamphilius; near Appelles is
Corregio; behind Raphaello stand Michael Angelo and Leonardo da Vinci,
and behind them, Ghiberti, Donatello, Massachio, Brunaleschi, Albert
Drer, Giotto, and Cimabue.</p>

<p>In the top of this part of the picture the painter has happily glanced
at what is called by astronomers the System of Systems, where the fixed
stars, considered as so many suns, each with his several planets,
are revolving round the Great Cause of all things; and representing
everything as affected by intelligence, has shown each system carried
along in its revolution by an angel. Though only a small portion of
this article can be seen, yet enough is shown to manifest the sublimity
of the idea.</p>

<p>In the other corner of the picture the artist has represented Tartarus,
where, among cataracts of fire and clouds of smoke, two large hands are
seen, one of them holding a fire-fork, the other pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> down a number
of figures bound together by serpenting War, Gluttony, Extravagance,
Detraction, Parsimony, and Ambition: and floating down the fiery gulf
are Tyranny, Hypocrisy, and Cruelty, with their proper attributes; the
whole of this excellent picture proving, in the most forcible manner,
the truth of that maxim which cannot be too often inculcated: "That
the attainment of man's true rank in the creation, and his present
and future happiness, individual as well as public, depended on the
cultivation and proper direction of the human faculties."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the Barry pictures, there are, in the Council Room,
full-length portraits of the first president by Gainsborough, and of
the second president of the Society, Lord Romney, by Reynolds, together
with a portrait of Barry. Here, also, are portraits of the Prince
Consort (who was president from 1843 until his death in 1861), painted
by Horsley, and of the late Queen Victoria and the royal children,
painted by Cope. One of the first prizes of the Society was adjudged
to Richard Cosway, then a boy of twelve, and afterwards so eminent
as a portrait painter in oil and miniatures. But this was before the
Society had removed to the Adelphi. John Bacon, Joseph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> Nollekens, and
William Woollett, George Romney, John Flexman, J.M.W. Turner, Edwin
Landseer, William Mulready, J.E. Millais, and many other distinguished
artists were awarded premiums by the Society, which, says Mr Wheatley,
"has been active in promoting commercial and technical education by
means of examinations. Out of the technological examinations has grown
the wide-spreading action of the City and Guilds of London Technical
Institute. A large number of the chief questions of the day, such as
the amendment of the Patent Laws; the cheapening of letter, book, and
parcel postage; the improvement of musical education, etc., have been
dealt with by the Society in the form of discussion and by addresses
to the Government. Several conferences have also been held on sanitary
matters and on water supply.</p>

<p>The ordinary meetings are held on Wednesday evenings at 8 p.m., from
November to May, when papers are read and discussed on subjects
relating to arts, manufactures and commerce. There are also connected
with the Society three sections: 1. Indian; 2. Foreign and Colonial;
3. Applied Art. These hold meetings for the reading and discussion of
papers on their respective subjects on other days of the week. Courses
of lectures on popular subjects connected with arts and manufactures
are delivered on Monday evenings, and are styled Cantor Lectures, by
reason that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> they owe their origin to a bequest of the late Dr Cantor.
The Albert Medal, founded in honour of the Prince Consort, is awarded
annually to some eminent man who has distinguished himself by promoting
arts, manufactures, or commerce. The first award was to Sir Rowland
Hill in 1864, and the list of recipients forms a noble roll of great
men."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Her late Majesty, Queen Victoria, was awarded the Society's
medal in her jubilee year, 1887.</p>

<p>The notorious quack doctor Joshua Ward (1685-1761), who was caricatured
by Hogarth, allowed the Italian sculptor, Agostino Carlini, 100 a
year, so that he should work on his statue for life. The impudent
inventor of "Friar's Balsam" left this statue to the Society of Arts.
This quack, who was nicknamed "Spot" Ward, from a birth-mark on his
cheek, was the son of a London dry-salter. His skill was so extolled by
General Churchill and Lord Chief Baron Reynolds, that he was called in
to prescribe for George II. Despite his "remedies"&mdash;his famous "drop
and pill" was a dangerous compound of antimony&mdash;the King recovered,
and "Spot" Ward was solemnly voted the thanks of a credulous House of
Parliament and allowed the privilege of driving his carriage through
St James's Park. He tried to enter Parliament by fraud in 1717, and
fled to St Germain, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> maintained himself by his "universal
remedies." Pardoned in 1733, he had a wonderful career in London, and
amassed a fortune.</p>

<p class="caption">ENTRANCE TO THE ADELPHI ARCHES.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of the literary associations of the Adelphi
is connected, in tradition, with Oliver Goldsmith, and, as a matter of
fact, with Samuel Johnson, both of whom appeared before the Society
of Arts. "The great room of the Society now mentioned," says Andrew
Kippis, the Nonconformist divine and biographer, at the close of his
memoir of Gilbert Cooper, in the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> "was for
several years the place where many people chose to try, or to display,
their oratorical abilities. Dr Goldsmith, I remember, made an attempt
at a speech, but was obliged to sit down in confusion. I once heard
Doctor Johnson speak there, upon a subject relating to Mechanics, with
a propriety, perspicuity, and energy which excited general admiration."
On the other hand, we have the testimony of Boswell that Johnson did
not distinguish himself as a speaker in the Adelphi. "I remember that
it was observed by Mr Flood, that Johnson, having been long used to
sententious brevity and the short flights of conversation, might
have failed in that continued and expanded kind of argument which is
requisite in stating complicated matters in public speaking; and, as
a proof of this, he mentioned the supposed speeches in Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
written by him for the magazine, none of which, in his opinion, were at
all like real debates. The opinion of one who was himself so eminent
an orator must be allowed to have great weight. It was confirmed by
Sir William Scott [Baron Stowell, the great Admiralty lawyer], who
mentioned that Johnson had told him that he had several times tried
to speak in the Society of Arts and Manufactures, but 'had found he
could not get on.' From Mr William Gerard Hamilton, I have heard that
Johnson, when observing to him that it was prudent for a man who had
not been accustomed to speak in public to begin his speech in as simple
a manner as possible, acknowledged that he rose in that Society to
deliver a speech which he had prepared; 'but,' said he, 'all my flowers
of oratory forsook me.'"</p>

<p>I am sorry to destroy a long-cherished illusion, but the worthy
Dr Kippis is in error in "remembering" Goldsmith attempting to
make a speech in "the great room" of the Society of Arts. This
room was not opened until 1774, and on April 4th of that year,
Goldsmith&mdash;unfortunately for the Kippis tradition&mdash;with a mind ill at
ease, departed life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shades of David Garrick and Dr Johnson must haunt the
Adelphi. Johnson was a constant visitor here. The Adelphi buildings
are very much as they were in his lifetime, whereas most of his Fleet
Street habitations are either swept away or sadly marred. But, although
the Embankment and the Gardens below Adelphi Terrace have taken the
place of the unsightly wharves and the muddy river of Johnson's day,
the house occupied by David Garrick for some six or seven years before
his death, and wherein he died, is still standing. The great actor
purchased the property, and, consequently, we may look in vain for
any mention of it in the <i>Particulars</i> of <i>the Adelphi Lottery</i>, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
which I have already made reference. During these last few years of
his life, Garrick&mdash;who spent the summer at his country residence at
Hampton&mdash;busied himself in the foundation of a great charitable bequest
for his fellow-players. At his suggestion, and upon his advice, the
Drury Lane Fund was established, a special Act of Parliament, for which
he provided all the necessary expenses, being obtained for the sanction
and support of the institution, in January, 1776. He also gave to it
all the money which he received on the occasion of his taking leave
of the stage. "It is computed that by the product of his labours, in
acting annually capital parts, and by donations of one kind or another,
he bestowed for this beneficial institution a capital of near 4,500 L."</p>

<p>It was from his house in the Adelphi&mdash;No. 5, the centre house of the
Terrace&mdash;which, by the way, was then known as Royal Terrace&mdash;that the
great actor set out on the eventful 10th of June, 1776, for the stage
of Drury Lane Theatre, whereon he then made his last appearance. He
acted Don Felix, in Mrs Centlivre's comedy, <i>The Wonder, a Woman keeps
a Secret</i>. He had previously disposed of his interest in the patent,
for the sum of 35,000, to Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Richard Ford.
Before his actual farewell, he gave the public an opportunity of
seeing him in several of his other favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> characters, including
Hamlet, Richard III., and King Lear. He only acted Richard once during
his farewell season, and that was by command of George III. "His
Majesty," we are told, "was much surprised to see him, in an age so
advanced" (he was just then sixty years old) "run about the field of
battle with so much fire, force, and agility." On the conclusion of
his performance of Don Felix, Garrick approached the footlights, "with
much palpitation of mind, and visible emotion in his countenance. No
premeditation could prepare him for this affecting scene. He bowed&mdash;he
paused&mdash;the spectators were all attention. After a short struggle
of nature, he recovered from the shock," and thus addressed the
audience:&mdash;"Ladies and gentlemen, it has been customary with persons
under my circumstances to address you in a farewell epilogue. I had the
same intention, and turned my thoughts that way; but indeed I found
myself then as incapable of writing such an epilogue as I should be
now of speaking it. The jingle of rhyme and the language of fiction
would but ill suit my present feelings. This is to me a very awful
moment; it is no less than parting for ever with those from whom I have
received the greatest kindness and favours, and upon the spot where
that kindness and those favours were received." (Here he was unable to
proceed till he was relieved by a shower of tears.) "Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> may be
the changes of my future life, the deepest impression of your kindness
will always remain here" (putting his hand on his breast), "fixed and
unalterable. I will very readily agree to my successors having more
skill and ability for their station than I have; but I defy them all to
take more sincere and more uninterrupted pains for your favour, or to
be more truly sensible of it than is your humble servant." The crowded
and brilliant audience rewarded the actor with renewed acclamations and
many tears; and, making a "profound obeisance," he left the stage.</p>

<p>Garrick, despite his retirement from the theatre, still took great
interest in it. He read and approved the tragedy of <i>Percy</i>, which
had been written by Hannah More, the religious writer (1745-1833),
and was instrumental in its production, at Covent Garden, in 1777. He
also wrote the prologue and the epilogue to the play. He frequently
attended the debates in the House of Commons. In the spring of 1777,
he unwittingly provoked a marked compliment to his splendid position
in the great world of artistic and literary London. Happening to
be present in the Strangers' Gallery during a certain motion which
produced some bickering between two right honourable gentlemen,
"which proceeded to such a degree of warmth that the Speaker had
to interfere," an unhappy member for Shropshire, observing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> that
Garrick was seated in the Gallery, thereupon moved a resolution for
the clearing of the House. "Roscius," however, managed to withdraw
himself from further observation, and thus avoided the consequences
of the ungenerous suggestion. The same unfortunate member, on the
following day, essayed to address the House on the impropriety of
suffering players to hear the debates, whereupon no less a person than
Edmund Burke arose, and, appealing to the honourable assembly, asked
whether "it could possibly be consistent with the rules of decency and
liberality to exclude from the hearing of their debates a man to whom
they were all obliged, one who was the great master of eloquence, in
whose school they had all imbibed the art of speaking and been taught
the elements of rhetoric. For his part, he owned that he had been
greatly indebted to his instructions. Much more he said in commendation
of Mr Garrick, and was warmly seconded by Mr Fox and Mr T. Townshend,
who very copiously displayed the great merit of their old preceptor, as
they termed him; they reprobated the motion of the gentleman with great
warmth and indignation."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The House, with almost complete unanimity,
concurred in this eulogium, and the actor, returning to the Adelphi,
wrote the following lines on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"> THE FOX-UNDER-THE-HILL.</p>

<p>The strong bond of friendship which existed between Hannah More and Mr
and Mrs Garrick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> is one of the most remarkable events in the history
of literature and the stage. On the one side, there was unbounded
admiration for the great actor; on the other, Garrick and his wife
evidently held the young writer in the highest esteem. The letters
written, and received by, Hannah More, from the time of her first
meeting with Garrick, until the death of his widow, form a charming
note in the lives of these three people. They bridge over the years
1776 to 1822. In the former year, it should be borne in mind, the
actor was nearly sixty years old, his wife a little younger, while
Hannah More was but thirty-one years of age. The affection of the
elderly couple for their young protge is remarkable, and, curiously
enough, the career of the latter began with Garrick's leaving the
stage. On June 10, 1776, Hannah More writes to David Garrick: "I think,
by the time this reaches you, I may congratulate you on the end of
your labours and the completion of your fame&mdash;a fame which has had no
parallel, and will have no end. Yet whatever reputation the world may
ascribe to you, I, who have had the happy privilege of knowing you
intimately, shall always think you derived your greatest glory from the
temperance with which you enjoyed it and the true greatness of mind
with which you lay it down. Surely, to have suppressed your talents
in the moment of your highest capacity for exercising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> them, does as
much honour to your heart as the exertion itself did to your dramatic
character; but I cannot trust myself with this subject, because I am
writing to the man himself; yet I ought to be indulged, for is not
the recollection of my pleasures all that is left me of them? Have I
not seen in one season that man act seven-and-twenty times, and rise
each time in excellence, and shall I be silent? Have I not spent three
months under the roof of that man and his dear charming lady, and
received from them favours that would take me another three months to
tell over, and shall I be silent?</p>

<p>"But highly as I enjoy your glory (for I do enjoy it most heartily,
and seem to partake it too, as I think a ray of it falls on all your
friends), yet I tremble for your health. It is impossible you can do
so much mischief to the nerves of other people without hurting your
own,&mdash;in <i>Richard</i> especially, where your murders are by no means
confined to the Tower: but you assassinate your whole audience who have
hearts. I say, I tremble lest you should suffer for all this; but it is
now over, as I hope are the bad effects of it upon yourself. You may
break your wand at the end of your trial, when you lay down the office
of <i>haut intendant</i> of the passions; but the enchantment it raised you
can never break, while the memories and feelings remain of those who
were ever admitted into the magic circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"This letter is already of a good impudent length, and to the person,
of all others, who has the least time to read nonsense. I will not
prolong my impertinence, but to beg and conjure that I may hear a
little bit about your finishing night. The least scrap&mdash;printed or
manuscript&mdash;paragraph or advertisement&mdash;merry or serious&mdash;verse or
prose, will be thankfully received, and hung up in the temple of
reliques.</p>

<p>"Pray tell my sweet Mrs Garrick I live on the hope of hearing from her.
And tell her further that she and you have performed a miracle, for you
have loaded one person with obligations, and have not made an ingrate."</p>

<p>A few months later Hannah More beseeches Garrick to write her a
prologue to <i>Percy</i>. Garrick received her letter just as he was
about to leave the Adelphi for a trip on the river. But he replied
immediately, in the following characteristic way: "Write you an
epilogue! Give you a pinch of snuff! By the greatest good luck in the
world, I received your letter when I was surrounded with ladies and
gentlemen, setting out upon a party to go up the Thames. Our expedition
will take us seven or eight days upon the most limited calculations.
They would hardly allow me a moment to write this scrawl: I snatched up
the first piece of paper (and a bad one it is) to tell you how unhappy
I am that I cannot confer upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> you so small a favour directly. If you
will let me know immediately, by a line directed to me at the Adelphi,
for whom you intend the epilogue, and what are her or his strong marks
of character in the play (for my copy is in town, or with Miss Young),
I will do my best on my return. I must desire you not to rely upon me
this time, on account of my present situation; I could as soon sleep
in a whirlwind as write among these ladies, and I shall be so fatigued
with talking myself, and hearing them talk, or I could sit up all night
to obey your commands."</p>

<p>Garrick complied with the request, and Hannah More writes, on June
16, 1777, to thank him: "I beg to return you my hearty thanks for
your goodness in sending me your delightful prologue. That you should
think me not unworthy to possess so great a treasure flatters more
than my vanity. And that you should send it me so soon makes it doubly
gratifying. I have read and re-read it with all the malice of a friend,
and pronounce that I never read a sweeter or more beautiful thing....
Many thanks, dear sir, for your good and wholesome advice about my
play. I do nothing, except regret my own idleness. I tremble for my
fifth act; but I am afraid I shall never make others tremble at it. My
love and duty to my sweet Mrs Garrick, and my thankful compliments to
the young lady to whose transcription I am so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> obliged; she is
astonishingly correct, not the smallest error."</p>

<p>Hannah More was then invited to visit the Garricks. "As soon as I got
to London," she writes to her sister, "I drove straight to the Adelphi,
where, to my astonishment, I found a coach waiting for me to carry me
to Hampton. Upon my arrival here, I was immediately put in possession
of my old chamber. Garrick is all good humour, vivacity, and wit.
While I think of it, I must treat you with a little distich which Mrs
Barbauld wrote extempore, on my showing my Felix Buckles (the elegant
buckles which Garrick wore the last time he ever acted, and with which
he presented me as a relic):</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Thy buckles, O Garrick, thy friend may now use,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But no mortal hereafter shall tread in thy shoes?'"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Where, I wonder, are those "Felix Buckles" now, with their double
association of David Garrick and Hannah More! During this visit to
the Garricks, the company who "did honour" to the actor and his wife
included Dr Burney, Sheridan, Lord Palmerston, and others of note.
"Roscius" was in the best of spirits and "literally kept the table in
a roar for four hours. He told his famous story of 'Jack Pocklington'
in a manner so entirely new, and so infinitely witty, that the company
have done nothing but talk of it ever since. I have often heard this
story: it is of a person who came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> to offer himself for the stage, with
an impediment in his speech. He gives the character, too, in as strong
a manner as Fielding could have done."</p>

<p>Hannah More was brought into very close relationship with the Garricks
in the autumn of 1777, through the play in which Garrick had interested
himself. On October 17, he sends a letter to her from the Adelphi:
"Shame! shame! shame! You may well say so, my dear madam; but indeed
I have been so disagreeably entertained with the gout running all
about me, from head to heel, that I have been unfit for the duties of
friendship; and very often for those which a good husband, and a good
friend, should never fail performing. I must gallop over this small
piece of paper; it was the first I snatched up, to tell you that my
wife has your letter, and thinks it a fine one and a sweet one.</p>

<p>"I was at court to-day, and such work they made with me, from the
Archbishop of Canterbury to the Page of the Back Stairs, that I have
been suffocated with compliments. We have wanted you at some of our
private hours. Where's the Nine? We want the Nine!<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Silent was every
muse!</p>

<p>"Cambridge said yesterday, in a large company at the Bishop of
Durham's, where I dined, that your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> ode to my house-dog was a very
witty production; and he thought there was nothing to be altered or
amended except in the last stanza, which he thought the only weak
one. I am afraid that you asked me to do something for you about the
parliament, which in my multitude of matters was overlooked; pray, if
it is of consequence, let me know it again, and you may be assured of
the intelligence you want.</p>

<p>"The last new tragedy, <i>Semiramis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> has, though a bare translation,
met with great success. The prologue is a bad one, as you may read in
the papers, by the author: the epilogue is grave, but a sweet pretty
elegant morsel, by Mr Sheridan; it had deservedly great success. Mr
Mason's <i>Caractacus</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> is not crowded, but the men of taste, and
classical men, admire it much. Mrs Garrick sends a large parcel of
love to you all. I send mine in the same bundle. Pray write soon, and
forgive me all my delinquencies." Writing to her sister in November,
on the eve of the production of <i>Percy</i>, Hannah More says: "It is
impossible to tell you of all the kindness and friendship of the
Garricks; he thinks of nothing, talks of nothing, writes of nothing
but <i>Percy</i>. He is too sanguine; it will have a fall, and so I tell
him. When Garrick had finished his prologue and epilogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> (which are
excellent) he desired I would pay him. Dryden, he said, used to have
five guineas a piece, but as he was a richer man he would be content
if I would treat him with a handsome supper and a bottle of claret. We
haggled sadly about the price, I insisting that I could only afford to
give him a beefsteak and a pot of porter; and at about twelve we sat
down to some toast and honey, with which the temperate bard contented
himself. Several very great ones made interest to hear Garrick read the
play, which he peremptorily refused. I supped on Wednesday night at Sir
Joshua's, spent yesterday morning at the Chancellor's, and the evening
at Mrs Boscawen's, Lady Bathurst being of the party."</p>

<p>Then comes another note, from <i>Mr Garrick's study, Adelphi, ten at
night</i>: "He himself puts the pen into my hand, and bids me say that all
is just as it should be. Nothing was ever more warmly received. I went
with Mr and Mrs Garrick; sat in Mr Harris's box, in a snug dark corner,
and behaved very well, that is, very quietly. The prologue and epilogue
were received with bursts of applause; so indeed was the whole; as much
beyond my expectation as my deserts! Mr Garrick's kindness has been
unceasing."</p>

<p><i>Percy</i>, it may be observed, was Hannah More's most important play. The
author had previously published a pastoral drama, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span><i>The Search after
Happiness</i>, for the edification of school children, and her tragedy,
<i>The Inflexible Captive</i>, was acted on one occasion in Bath. Her
fourth play, <i>The Fatal Falsehood</i>, failed, at Covent Garden, in 1779.
The success of <i>Percy</i> was largely due to Garrick's friendly help.
Wroughton, "Gentleman" Lewis, and Mrs Crawford played the principal
parts. Garrick wrote the epilogue, as well as the prologue, and, by
the following lines from the latter, gave great offence to a French
lady, Mlle. D'Eon, a reputed natural daughter of Louis XV., who had a
"violent passion" for the military dress of an officer in preference to
the gown and petticoat of her own sex:</p>

</p>

<p>In January, 1778, Hannah More, flushed with the success of her tragedy,
was paying a round of visits in London. On one night she dined with
Mrs Delany, Mrs Boscawen, and the Duchess of Portland: on the next,
"at the Garricks with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> sour crout party"&mdash;a weekly dinner in the
Adelphi of learned men (sour crout being one of the dishes), to which
Hannah More was always invited. She was taken ill during this month,
and Mrs Garrick tried to induce her to stay with her, an invitation
which was not accepted. Mrs Garrick "would have gone herself to fetch
me a physician, and insisted upon sending me my dinner, which I
refused; but at six this evening, when Garrick came to the Turk's Head
to dine, there accompanied him, in the coach, a minced chicken in the
stew-pan, hot, a canister of her fine tea, and a pot of cream. Were
there ever such people! Tell it not in Epic, or in Lyric, that the
great Roscius rode with a stew-pan of minced meat with him in the coach
for my dinner." The Turk's Head, by the way, was "a noted rendezvous of
painters" and the home of the Artists' Club before, in the year 1764,
Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds founded the famous "Literary Club,"
the members of which met weekly for supper and conversation. Garrick
had been a member for three years when he brought the invalid's repast
from the Adelphi to the Turk's Head&mdash;which was in Gerrard Street, at
the corner of Greek Street and Compton Street. The actor was also kind
enough to invest the profit on <i>Percy</i>, on the best security and at
five per cent., so that it made a considerable addition to the income
of the young writer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>On a certain memorable Thursday, in 1778, Hannah More dined with the
Garricks in the Adelphi, and, in the evening, Garrick accompanied his
guest to a reception given by Sir Joshua Reynolds; the party included
Gibbon, Johnson, Hermes Harris, Burney, Chambers, Ramsey, the Bishop of
St Asaph, Boswell, and Langton; "and scarce an expletive man or woman
among them. Garrick put Johnson into such good spirits that I never
knew him so entertaining or more instructive. He was as brilliant as
himself, and as good-humoured as any one else."</p>

<p>The end of a great career was, unhappily, now approaching. Mr and
Mrs Garrick had been invited to spend the Christmas of 1778 at the
country seat of Earl Spencer, where they were honoured guests. In the
midst of the festivities, Garrick was seized with a return of an old
disorder&mdash;an affection of the kidneys. Early in January, however, he
had so far recovered that he was able to travel to London. He arrived
at his house in the Adelphi on January 15, and several physicians
were called in. One of them, seeing that the illness was serious, and
knowing that its course was certain, thought it necessary to tell the
actor that, if he had any worldly affairs to settle, "it would be
prudent to dispatch them as soon as possible." But Garrick made answer
that nothing of that sort lay on his mind, that he was not afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> to
die. About two days before his death, he was visited by an old friend,
who was persuaded to stay and dine with Mrs Garrick, who was greatly
fatigued by her long and constant attendance upon her husband, a duty
to which she invariably attended. While she was talking to the friend,
the dying actor came into the room; "but, oh! how changed! divested of
that vivacity and sprightliness which used to accompany everything he
said and everything he did! His countenance was sallow and wan, his
movements slow and solemn. He was wrapped in a rich night-gown, not
unlike that which he always wore in Lusignan, the venerable old king of
Jerusalem [in <i>Zara</i>]; he presented himself to the imagination of his
friend as if he was just ready to act that character. He sat down; and
during the space of an hour, the time he remained in the room, he did
not utter a word. He rose, and withdrew to his chamber. Mrs Garrick and
the Gentleman dined." What a sad dinner that must have been!</p>

<p>Just before his death, Garrick confided to a friend that he did
not regret being childless, for he knew that the quickness of his
feelings was so great that, in case it had been his misfortune to have
disobedient children, he could not have borne such an affliction.
On seeing a number of gentlemen in his apartment a few hours before
the end, he enquired who they were, and, on being told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> that they
were physicians who sought to do him service, he shook his head, and
repeated the following lines from Nicholas Rowe's <i>Fair Penitent</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"Another, and another, still succeeds;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the last fool is welcome as the former."</span><br />
</p>

<p>He died, with great composure, at eight o'clock on the morning of
January 20, 1779. On Monday, February 1, the body was conveyed from the
Adelphi to Westminster Abbey, and interred in Poet's Corner, a spot
made still further memorable in the annals of the stage by the burial
here&mdash;and close by the graves of David Garrick and Samuel Johnson&mdash;of
the remains of Henry Irving.</p>

<p>Before describing the magnificent funeral procession of David Garrick
from the Adelphi, let me glance for a moment at the widow of the
great actor and her deportment on this sad occasion. Thanks to Hannah
More&mdash;who had risen from a sick-bed, in Bristol, and had travelled
post-haste to London, at the express desire of her friend&mdash;we get a
most interesting account of Mrs Garrick at the time of her husband's
death:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She was prepared for meeting me; she ran into my arms, and we both
remained silent for some minutes; at last she whispered&mdash;'I have this
moment embraced his coffin, and you come next.' She soon recovered
herself, and said with great composure, 'The goodness of God to
me is inexpressible; I desired to die, but it is His will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> that I
should live, and He has convinced me He will not let my life be quite
miserable, for He gives astonishing strength to my body and <i>grace</i>
to my heart!&mdash;neither do I deserve; but I am thankful for both!' She
thanked me a thousand times for such a real act of friendship, and
bade me be comforted, for it was God's will. She told me they had just
returned from Althorp, Lord Spencer's, where he had been reluctantly
dragged, for he had felt unwell for some time; but during his visit he
was often in such fine spirits that they could not believe he was ill.
On his return home he appointed Dr Cadogan to meet him, who ordered him
an emetic, the warm bath, and the usual remedies, but with very little
effect. On the Sunday he was in good spirits and free from pain; but as
the suppression still continued, Dr Cadogan became extremely alarmed,
and sent for Pott, Heberden, and Schomberg, who gave him up the moment
they saw him. Poor Garrick stared to see his room full of doctors, not
being conscious of his real state. No change happened till the Tuesday
evening, when the surgeon who was sent for to blister and bleed him
made light of his illness, assuring Mrs Garrick that he would be well
in a day or two, and insisted on her going to lie down. Towards morning
she desired to be called if there was the least change. Every time that
she administered the draughts to him in the night, he always squeezed
her hand in a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> manner, and spoke to her with the greatest
tenderness and affection. Immediately after he had taken his last
medicine, he softly said, "Oh! dear," and yielded up his spirit without
a groan, in his perfect senses. His behaviour during the night was all
gentleness and patience, and he frequently made apologies to those
about him for the trouble he gave them.</p>

<p>"I paid a melancholy visit to his coffin yesterday, where I found food
for meditation, till the mind 'burst with thinking.' His new house is
not so pleasant as Hampton, nor so splendid as the Adelphi, but it is
commodious enough for all the wants of its inhabitant; and besides, it
is so quiet that he will never be disturbed till the eternal morning,
and never till then will a sweeter voice than his own be heard. May
he then find mercy! They are preparing to hang the house with black,
for he is to lie in state until Monday. I dislike this pageantry,
and cannot help thinking that the disembodied spirit must look with
contempt upon the farce that is played over its miserable relics. But a
splendid funeral could not be avoided, as he is to be laid in the Abbey
with such illustrious dust, and so many are desirous of testifying
their respect by attending."</p>

<p>While the preparations were being made for the funeral, Mrs Garrick
stayed at the house of a friend. But after the funeral she returned
to the Adelphi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> Hannah More, who came back with her, writes: "On
Wednesday night we came to the Adelphi&mdash;to this house! She bore it
with great tranquillity; but what was my surprise to see her go alone
into the chamber and bed in which he had died that day fortnight. She
had a delight in it beyond expression. I asked her the next day how
she went through it? She told me, 'Very well'; that she first prayed
with great composure, then went and kissed the dear bed, and got into
it with a sad pleasure." In reference to Garrick's death, the same
writer also says: "I can never cease to remember with affection and
gratitude, so warm, steady, and disinterested a friend; and I can
most truly bear this testimony to his memory, that I never witnessed,
in any family, more decorum, propriety, and regularity than in his:
where I never saw a card, or even met (except in one instance) a
person of his own profession at his table: of which Mrs Garrick, by
her elegance of taste, her correctness of manners, and very original
turn of humour, was the brightest ornament. All his pursuits and tastes
were so decidedly intellectual, that it made the society, and the
conversation which was always to be found in his circle, interesting
and delightful."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> funeral procession which wended its way from the Adelphi
Terrace, through Adam Street to the Strand and thence by way of
Whitehall to Westminster Abbey, on that winter's morning in February,
1779, was a lengthy and imposing one, though nowadays we should
consider such pomp and circumstance very lugubrious. First of all, came
four porters on horseback, their staffs, or wands of office, covered
with black silk and scarves. Then came six other men, with mourning
cloaks, followed by another official bearing a heavily-draped pennon.
Then came other six men carrying a surcoat of arms, a helmet with
crest, wreath, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> mantlet. A state lid of black ostrich feathers,
surrounded by escutcheons, immediately preceded the hearse, which was
'full-dressed'&mdash;that is to say, it bore at each corner and on the sides
waving black ostrich plumes. A state coach, empty, and with a page on
each side, was followed by a mourning coach containing the clergy from
St Martin's-in-the-Fields. Then came six more mourning coaches "with
the pall-bearers, two in each coach, six pages on each side. A ditto,
with the chief mourners, a page on each side. A ditto, with three
family ditto. A ditto, with three physicians. A ditto, with surgeon
and apothecaries, a page on each side. A ditto, with Messrs Sheridan
and Harris, a page on each side. Three ditto, with a deputation of
twelve gentlemen, performers from Drury-Lane theatre, three pages
on each side. Two men in mourning, on horseback, with cloaks, etc.
Three ditto, with a deputation of twelve gentlemen, performers from
Covent-garden theatre, three pages on each side. Two men in mourning,
on horseback, with cloaks, etc. Four mourning coaches, with the members
of the literary club, four pages on each side. Two men in mourning,
on horseback, with cloaks. Seven coaches with intimate friends of the
deceased, seven pages on each side. Mr Garrick's coach, empty. All the
gentlemen's family coaches, empty."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> body was received at the
great west door of the Abbey, about three o'clock, by the Bishop of
Rochester, Dean of Westminster, who, attended by the clergy and choir,
preceded the corpse up the centre aisle, during which time Purcell's
funeral music was played and sung.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Among those who followed the mournful procession from the Adelphi
were Lord Camden, the Lord Chancellor; the Earl of Ossory; the
Duke of Devonshire; Earl Spencer; the Right Hon. Richard Rigby,
and Viscount Palmerston, who, with others, were the pall-bearers.
The mourning coaches also contained Dr Johnson; George Colman, the
elder, the dramatist; John Dunning, afterwards Baron Ashburton, whose
<i>Inquiry into the Doctrines lately promulgated concerning Juries,
Libels</i>, etc., was pronounced by Horace Walpole "the finest piece
... written for liberty since Lord Somers"; Edmund Burke; Colonel
Isaac Barr, the Irish soldier and politician; the Hon. Charles Fox;
Lord Charles Spencer; the deputy usher of the black rod; and many
other distinguished men. The committee from Drury Lane consisted of
Richard Yates, Tom King, Vernon, William Parsons, James Dodd&mdash;an actor
who, according to Charles Lamb, "was a man of reading, and left at
his death a choice collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> old English literature"&mdash;Aickin,
John Palmer&mdash;an incomparable Joseph Surface&mdash;W. Bensley&mdash;the great
Malvolio of his day&mdash;William Brereton, John Moody, and Robert Baddeley.
From Covent Garden, there came "Gentleman" Lewis, Lee Lewes, John
Quick&mdash;George III.'s favourite comedian&mdash;and some nine other players of
good repute. It was said at the time that a greater concourse of people
attended than was ever known on a similar occasion.</p>

<p>Johnson, as all students of the stage are aware, had a sincere
admiration for Garrick, a fact that is proved by several references
in the pages of Boswell. A few months before the death of the player,
Johnson and Boswell dined with William Scott, in his chambers in
the Temple. The conversation turned upon fame, and Boswell "slily
introduced" the name of David Garrick, "and his assuming the airs of
a great man. <i>Johnson</i>: 'Sir, it is wonderful how <i>little</i> Garrick
assumes. No, Sir, Garrick <i>fortunam reverenter habet</i>. Consider,
Sir,&mdash;celebrated men such as you have mentioned have had their applause
at a distance; but Garrick had it dashed in his face, sounded in his
ears, and went home every night with the plaudits of a thousand in
his cranium. Then, Sir, Garrick did not <i>find</i>, but <i>made</i> his way
to the tables, the levees, and almost the bedchambers of the great.
Then, Sir, Garrick had under him a numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> body of people; who, from
fears of his power and hopes of his favour, and admiration of his
talents, were constantly submissive to him. And here is a man who has
advanced the dignity of his profession. Garrick has made a player a
higher character.' <i>Scott</i>: 'And he is a very sprightly writer too.'
<i>Johnson</i>: 'Yes, Sir; and all this supported by great wealth of his own
acquisition. If all this had happened to me, I should have had a couple
of fellows with long poles walking before me, to knock down everybody
that stood in the way. Consider, if all this had happened to Cibber or
to Quin, they'd have jumped over the moon. Yet Garrick speaks to <i>us</i>'
(smiling). <i>Boswell</i>: 'And Garrick is a very good man, a charitable
man.' <i>Johnson</i>: 'Sir, a liberal man. He has given away more money than
any man in England. There may be a little vanity mixed; but he has
shown that money is not his first object.' <i>Boswell</i>: 'Yet Foote used
to say of him, that he walked out with the intention to do a generous
action, but turning the corner of a street, he met the ghost of a
halfpenny, which frightened him.' <i>Johnson</i>: 'Why, Sir, that is very
true, too; for I never knew a man of whom it could be said with less
certainty to-day what he will do to-morrow, than Garrick; it depends
so much on his humour at the time.' <i>Scott</i>: 'I am glad to hear of his
liberality. He has been represented as very saving.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> <i>Johnson</i>: 'With
his domestic saving we have nothing to do. I remember drinking tea with
him long ago, when Peg Woffington made it, and he grumbled at her for
making it too strong. He had begun to feel money in his purse, and did
not know when he should have enough of it!'"</p>

<p>Shortly after Garrick's death, Johnson accorded the actor praise
that was even greater. The occasion was a dinner party, on April 24,
1779, at Topham Beauclerk's, at which Sir Joshua Reynolds, as well as
Johnson and Boswell, was present. Boswell mentioned that John Wilkes
had spoken of Garrick as a man who had no friend, a contention which
Johnson allowed to be right. "'He had friends, but no friend,' he said.
'Garrick was so diffused, he had no man to whom he wished to unbosom
himself. He found people always ready to applaud him, and that always
for the same thing; so he saw life with great uniformity.'" Whereupon,
Boswell, taking upon himself "for once, to fight with Goliath's
weapons, and play the sophist," said: "'Garrick did not need a friend,
as he got from everybody all that he wanted. What is a friend? One
who supports and comforts you, while others do not. Friendship, you
know, Sir, is the cordial drop "to make the nauseous draught of life
go down"; but if the draught be not nauseous, if it be all sweet,
there is no occasion for that drop.' <i>Johnson</i>: 'Many men would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
be content to live so. I hope I should not. They would wish to have
an intimate friend, with whom they might compare minds and cherish
private virtues.'" One of the company mentioned Lord Chesterfield as
a man who had no friend. "<i>Johnson</i>: 'There were more materials to
make friendship in Garrick, had he not been so diffused.' <i>Boswell</i>:
'Garrick was pure gold, but beat out to thin leaf. Lord Chesterfield
was tinsel.' <i>Johnson</i>: 'Garrick was a very good man, the most cheerful
man of his age; a decent liver in a profession which is supposed to
give indulgence to licentiousness; and a man who gave away, freely,
money acquired by himself. He began the world with a great hunger for
money; the son of a half-pay officer, bred in a family whose study was
to make fourpence do as much as others made fourpence halfpenny do. But
when he had got money he was very liberal.' I presumed to animadvert
on his eulogy on Garrick, in his <i>Lives of the Poets</i>. 'You say, Sir,
his death eclipsed the gaiety of nations.' <i>Johnson</i>: 'I could not have
said more or less. It is the truth: <i>eclipsed</i>, not <i>extinguished</i>;
and his death <i>did</i> eclipse; it was like a storm.' <i>Boswell</i>: 'But why
nations? Did his gaiety extend farther than his own nation?' <i>Johnson</i>:
'Why, sir, some exaggeration must be allowed. Besides, nations may be
said&mdash;if we allow the Scotch to be a nation&mdash;to have gaiety&mdash;which
they have not. <i>You</i> are an exception, though.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> Come, gentlemen,
let us candidly admit that there is one Scotchman who is cheerful.'
<i>Beauclerk</i>: 'But he is a very unnatural Scotchman.' I, however,
continued to think the compliment to Garrick hyperbolically untrue.
His acting had ceased some time before his death; at any rate he had
acted in Ireland but a short time, at an early period of his life, and
never in Scotland. I objected also to what appears an anti-climax of
praise, when contrasted with the preceding panegyric, 'and diminished
the public stock of harmless pleasure!' 'Is not <i>harmless pleasure</i>
very tame?' <i>Johnson</i>: 'Nay, Sir, harmless pleasure is the highest
praise. Pleasure is a word of dubious import; pleasure is, in general,
dangerous, and pernicious to virtue; to be able, therefore, to furnish
pleasure that is harmless, pleasure pure and unalloyed, is as great a
power as man can possess.'"</p>

<p>Johnson was a frequent visitor to Adelphi Terrace, for not only was he
on intimate terms with Mr and Mrs Garrick, but another of his friends,
Topham Beauclerk, lived there at one time. From 1757 to 1780, there
are frequent and most kindly allusions to him in the pages of Boswell.
In the former year, he matriculated at Oxford. Here he met another of
Johnson's friends&mdash;"High, shy, and dry" Bennet Langton, the eminent
Greek scholar. Beauclerk was a man of culture and of great knowledge
of the world. And he had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> good fortune to win the affectionate
regard of Dr Johnson. On March 10, 1768, Lady Diana Spencer, eldest
daughter of the second Duke of Marlborough, was divorced from her
husband, Lord St John and Bolingbroke, and, two days later, she was
married to Beauclerk, to whom "she made an excellent wife." Beauclerk
died, in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, on March 11, 1780. His
extensive library, which was particularly rich in English plays,
history, travel, and science, was dispersed by auction in 1781.</p>

<p>On Friday, April 20, 1781, there was a memorable dinner party in
Adelphi Terrace, the first of the kind given by Mrs Garrick since the
death of her husband. "We begin now," records Hannah More, who was
staying with Mrs Garrick at the time, "to be a little cheerful at home,
and to have our small parties. One such we have just had, and the day
and evening turned out very pleasant. Johnson was in full song, and I
quarrelled with him sadly. I accused him of not having done justice
to the <i>Allegro</i> and <i>Penseroso</i>. He spoke disparagingly of both. I
praised <i>Lycidas</i>, which he absolutely abused, adding, 'If Milton had
not written the <i>Paradise Lost</i>, he would have only ranked among the
minor poets: he was a Phidias that could cut a Colossus out of a rock,
but could not cut heads out of cherry-stones.</p>

<p>"Boswell brought to my mind the whole of a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> mirthful conversation
at dear Mrs Garrick's, and my being made by Sir William Forbes the
umpire in a trial of skill between Garrick and Boswell, which could
most nearly imitate Dr Johnson's manner. I remember I gave it for
Boswell in familiar conversation, and for Garrick in reciting poetry.
Mrs Boscawen shone with her usual mild lustre."</p>

<p>Boswell, in recording this auspicious event in the history of the
Adelphi, says that it was "one of the happiest days that I remember to
have enjoyed in the whole course of my life. Mrs Garrick, whose grief
for the loss of her husband was, I believe, as sincere as wounded
affection and admiration could produce, had this day, for the first
time since his death, a select party of his friends to dine with her.
The company was, Miss Hannah More, who lived with her, and whom she
called her chaplain; Mrs Boscawen, Mrs Elizabeth Carter, Sir Joshua
Reynolds, Dr Burney, Dr Johnson, and myself. We found ourselves very
elegantly entertained at her house in the Adelphi, where I have passed
many a pleasing hour with him who gladdened life. She looked well,
talked of her husband with complacency, and while she cast her eyes
on his portrait, which hung over the chimney-piece, said, that 'death
was now the most agreeable object to her.' The very semblance of David
Garrick was cheering. Mr Beauclerk, with happy propriety, inscribed
under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> that fine portrait of him, which by Lady Diana's kindness is now
the property of my friend, Mr Langton, the following passage from his
beloved Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">'A merrier man,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Within the limit of becoming mirth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I never spent an hour's talk withal.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His eye begets occasion for his wit;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For every object that the one doth catch,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The other turns to a mirth-moving jest;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Which his fair tongue (Conceit's expositor)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Delivers in such apt and gracious words,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That aged ears play truant at his tales,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And younger hearings are quite ravished;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So sweet and voluble is his discourse.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>"We were all in fine spirits; and I whispered to Mrs Boscawen, 'I
believe this is as much as can be made of life.' In addition to a
splendid entertainment, we were regaled with Lichfield ale, which had
a peculiar appropriate value. Sir Joshua, and Dr Burney, and I, drank
cordially of it to Dr Johnson's health; and though he would not join
us, he as cordially answered, 'Gentlemen, I wish you all as well as you
do me.'</p>

<p>"The general effect of this day dwells upon my mind in fond
remembrance: but I do not find much conversation recorded. What I have
preserved shall be faithfully given.</p>

<p>"One of the company mentioned Mr Thomas Hollis, the strenuous Whig, who
used to send over Europe, presents of democratical books, with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
boards stamped with daggers and caps of liberty. Mrs Carter said, 'he
was a bad man: he used to talk uncharitably.' <i>Johnson</i>: 'Poh! poh!
Madam; who is the worse for being talked of uncharitably? Besides, he
was a dull poor creature as ever lived: and I believe he would not have
done harm to a man whom he knew to be of very opposite principles to
his own. I remember once at the Society of Arts, when an advertisement
was to be drawn up, he pointed me out as the man who could do it best.
This, you will observe, was kindness to me. I, however, slipped away,
and escaped it.'</p>

<p>"Mrs Carter having said of the same person, 'I doubt he was an
atheist.' <i>Johnson</i>: 'I don't know that. He might perhaps have become
one, if he had time to ripen (<i>smiling</i>). He might have <i>exuberated</i>
into an atheist.'</p>

<p>"Sir Joshua Reynolds praised <i>Mudge's Sermons</i>. <i>Johnson</i>: '<i>Mudge's
Sermons</i> are good but not practical. He grasps more corn than he can
make into meal; he opens a wide prospect, but it is so distant, it is
indistinct. I love <i>Blair's Sermons</i>. Though the dog is a Scotchman,
and a Presbyterian, and everything he should not be, I was the first to
praise them. Such was my candour' (<i>smiling</i>). <i>Mrs Boscawen</i>: 'Such
his great merit, to get the better of all your prejudices.' <i>Johnson</i>:
'Why, Madam, let us compound the matter; let us ascribe it to my
candour and his merit.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the evening we had a large company in the drawing-room; several
ladies, the Bishop of Killaloe, Dr Percy, Mr Chamberlayne of the
Treasury, &amp;c., &amp;c. Somebody said, the life of a mere literary man could
not be very entertaining. <i>Johnson</i>: 'But it certainly may. This is a
remark which has been made, and repeated without justice; why should
the life of a literary man be less entertaining than the life of any
other man? Are there not as interesting varieties in such a life? As
<i>a literary life</i> it may be very entertaining.' <i>Boswell</i>: 'But it
must be better surely, when it is diversified with a little active
variety&mdash;such as his having gone to Jamaica; or&mdash;his having gone to the
Hebrides.' Johnson was not displeased at this.</p>

<p>"Talking of a very respectable author, he told us a curious
circumstance in his life, which was, that he had married a printer's
devil. <i>Reynolds</i>: 'A printer's devil, Sir! Why, I thought a printer's
devil was a creature with a black face and in rags.' <i>Johnson</i>: 'Yes,
Sir. But I suppose he had her face washed, and put clean clothes
on her. (Then looking very serious and very earnest.) And she did
not disgrace him;&mdash;the woman had a bottom of good sense.' The word
<i>bottom</i>, thus introduced, was so ludicrous, when contrasted with his
gravity, that most of us could not forbear tittering and laughing;
though I recollect that the Bishop of Killaloe kept his countenance
with perfect steadi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>ness, while Miss Hannah More slily hid her face
behind a lady's back who sat on the same settee with her. His pride
could not bear that any expression of his should excite ridicule, when
he did not intend it; he therefore resolved to assume and exercise
despotic power, glanced sternly around, and called out, in a strong
tone, 'Where's the merriment?' Then collecting himself, and looking
awful, to make us feel how he could impose restraint, and as it
were searching his mind for a still more ludicrous word, he slowly
pronounced, 'I say the <i>woman</i> was <i>fundamentally</i> sensible'; as if he
had said, hear this now, and laugh if you dare. We all sat composed as
at a funeral.</p>

<p>"He and I walked away together; we stopped a little while by the rails
of the Adelphi, looking on the Thames, and I said to him, with some
emotion, that I was now thinking of two friends we had lost, who once
lived in the buildings behind us, Beauclerk and Garrick. 'Ay, Sir,'
said he tenderly, 'and two such friends as cannot be supplied.'"</p>

<p>Hannah More spent many months with Mrs Garrick&mdash;the winter at Hampton,
the spring in the Adelphi&mdash;after the death of the celebrated player,
and from her letters written in the Adelphi, we obtain several passages
of note, apart from that of the famous dinner party of April 20, 1781.
Thus, early in 1779, soon after Garrick's decease, we find that the
widow and her friend were visited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> various ladies: "Mrs Montague
and Mrs Vesey have spent one afternoon with us; and these with Ladies
Bathurst, Edgecombe, and Spencer, are all we have seen." She then goes
on to describe her way of life as being "very different" from what
it used to be in Garrick's time. "After breakfast, I go to my own
apartment for several hours, where I read, write, and work; very seldom
letting anybody in, though I have a room for separate visitors, but I
almost look on a morning visit as an immorality. At four we dine. We
have the same elegant table as usual, but I generally confine myself to
one single dish of meat. I have taken to drink half a glass of wine. At
six we have coffee; at eight tea, when we have, sometimes, a dowager or
two of quality. At ten we have sallad and fruits. Each has her book,
which we read without any restraint, as if we were alone, without
apologies or speech-making." During this visit, her play, <i>The Fatal
Falsehood</i>, was produced at Covent Garden, but, as already recorded,
was not a success. It lacked the guiding hand of her old friend. "We
have stolen away for a few days to town," she writes in 1781, "but I
am now so habituated to quiet, that I have scarcely the heart to go
out, though I am come here on purpose. As to poor Mrs Garrick, she
keeps herself as secret as a piece of smuggled goods, and neither stirs
out herself, or lets any body in. The calm of Hampton is such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> fixed
repose, that an old woman crying fish, or the postman ringing at the
door, is an event which excites attention."</p>

<p>A little later on, Mrs Garrick and Hannah More were invited to an
assembly at Mrs Thrale's. "Just as my hair was dressed, came a servant
to forbid our coming, for that Mr Thrale was dead. A very few hours
later, and he would have died in this assembly. What an awful event.
He was in the prime of life, but had the misfortune to be too rich,
and to keep too sumptuous a table, at which he indulged too freely. He
was a sensible and respectable man. I am glad the poor lady has, in
her distress, such a friend as Dr Johnson; he will suggest the best
motives of consolation." A few days after this event, "we were a small
and very choice party at Bishop Shipley's. Lord and Lady Spencer, Lord
and Lady Althorpe, Sir Joshua, Langton, Boswell, Gibbon, and, to my
agreeable surprise, Dr Johnson, were there." This was the first meeting
between Johnson and Mrs Garrick since the latter's bereavement, and,
on the next morning, Johnson paid a lengthy visit to the ladies at No.
5 Adelphi Terrace. "On Mrs Garrick's telling him she was always more
at her ease with persons who had suffered the same loss with herself,
he said that was a comfort she could seldom have, considering the
superiority of his [Garrick's] merit, and cordiality of their union. He
bore his strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> testimony to the liberality of Garrick. He reproved
me with pretended sharpness for reading <i>Les Penses de Pascal</i>, or
any of the Port Royal authors; alleging that, as a good Protestant,
I ought to abstain from books written by Catholics. I was beginning
to stand upon my defence, when he took me with both hands, and with
a tear running down his cheeks, 'Child,' said he, with the most
affecting earnestness, 'I am heartily glad that you read pious books,
by whomsoever they may be written.'" Then came the famous dinner party
which Dr Johnson attended, and that was his last visit to the Adelphi,
for, during Hannah More's visits to town in the subsequent years,
prior to Johnson's death in 1784, the Doctor was ailing. So, with
this picture in the mind's eye of the worthy Doctor, in sentimental
mood, now lecturing Hannah More, anon entertaining Mrs Garrick and
her friends, and, finally, looking across the Adelphi railings at the
Thames, as he thought tenderly of his dead friends, we take leave of
Samuel Johnson.</p>

<p>Mrs Garrick, who was a Catholic, be it said, was by no means
prejudiced, and she gave way to Hannah More's religious scruples: "It
is very considerate in Mrs Garrick, to decline asking company on Sunday
on my account; so that I enjoy the whole day to myself. I swallow no
small portion of theology of different descriptions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> as I always
read, when visiting, such books as I do not possess at home. After my
more select reading I have attacked South, Atterbury, and Warburton.
In these great geniuses, and original thinkers, I see many passages
of scripture presented in a striking and strong light. I think it
right to mix their learned labours with the devout effusions of more
spiritual writers, Baxter, Doddridge, Hall, Hopkins, Jeremy Taylor (the
Shakespeare of divinity), and the profound Barrow in turn. I devour
much, but, I fear, digest little. In the evening, I read a sermon and
prayers to the family, which Mrs G. much likes." She frequently went
from the Adelphi to the Church of St Clement Dane's, in the Strand.
It gave her "peculiar pleasure to think" that she "there partook of
the holy sacrament with Johnson the last time he ever received it in
public."</p>

<p>On a certain Wednesday in 1785, "we had a great dinner at home"&mdash;in the
Adelphi&mdash;"for the first time this year, Mrs Garrick disliking company
more and more. The party consisted of the Smelts, the Montagus, the
Boyles, the Walsinghams, Mrs Carter, Mr Walpole, and Miss Hamilton.
Though I like them every one separately, yet it was impossible to enjoy
them altogether; and I never desire to sit down with more than six, or
eight at the outside, to dinner." In 1786, she records, with a certain
amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> ingenuousness: "I am this day in the full enjoyment of a
most complete holiday&mdash;Mrs Garrick is gone to Hampton. I have refused
all invitations, and have ordered that nobody should be let in, that I
may have the luxury of one quiet uninterrupted day. I woke with great
delight in the very anticipation of it."</p>

<p>It is a long jump from 1786 to 1814, but Hannah More had many
occupations during this period, and, apparently, but little time for
writing to her old friend, for, in December of the latter year, Mrs
Garrick sends to her, begging for some news of the world. Her letter is
addressed to "My dearest friend," and runs thus: "If you could imagine
how much pleasure a letter from you gives me, you would oftener favour
me with one. As writing is no trouble to you, you might now and then
bestow a moment upon me, to tell me what passes in London; for I am
quite unacquainted with the world of folly. I almost thanked God for
my illness, during all the time that every person ran mad to see for
six weeks together the same thing. Now, if I could have seen the royal
strangers with ease, I should have been glad to have seen them; but as
that was out of my power (if I had been in health), as I have almost
out-lived my London friends, I have seen nothing, so I must trust to
what I am told.</p>

<p>"Indeed, my beloved friend, I have been very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> near parting for ever
from this world; but the great care taken of me set me up again
upon my feet, but not so high as my knees, for they are as yet very
<i>doddering</i>. But when you consider that I am six months past ninety,
you would say that I am a wonder still if you were to see me. I do not
often shew my teeth, as there is but one and a quarter left. God bless
you all! and love me, as I do you all, from my very soul." The death
of Mrs Garrick occurred on October 16, 1822&mdash;over forty-three years
after the death of her husband. She had been invited by Robert William
Elliston to a private view of Drury Lane Theatre, which he had just
redecorated, and, while preparing to leave her house in the Adelphi,
a servant handed her a cup of tea. She had hardly raised it to her
lips when she fell back in her chair, and passed away peacefully, in
her ninety-ninth year. She was interred in Westminster Abbey, close
by the remains of her husband, on October 25. The news of her death
reached Hannah More on October 20, and is thus alluded to by her: "I
was much affected yesterday with a report of the death of my ancient
and valued friend, Mrs Garrick. She was in her hundredth year! I spent
above twenty winters under her roof, and gratefully remember not only
their personal kindness, but my first introduction, through them, into
a society remarkable for rank, literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> and talents. Whatever was
most distinguished in either, was to be found at their table. He was
the very soul of conversation." David Garrick, it may be recorded, died
in the back-room of the first floor of his house, his widow in the
front drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mrs Garrick was a native of Vienna, where, in her youth, she acquired
much celebrity as a dancer. Her maiden name was Eva Maria Violetta.
She was remarkably beautiful in her face and person, and it is said
that she retained, until the day of her death, that erect deportment
which she had acquired as a dancer. She was married to Garrick in June,
1749, first at a Protestant, then at a Roman Catholic Chapel. After
the testimony already given in these pages, it is almost superfluous
to say that the actor and his wife were a very happy couple. "It is
remarkable," said a public journal at the time of her death, "that
during the whole period of their marriage"&mdash;thirty years&mdash;"whatever
invitations they received, or excursions they took, they never once
slept asunder." On August 15, 1755, Walpole writes: "I dined to-day
at Garrick's; there were the Duke of Grafton, Lord and Lady Rochford,
Lady Holdernesse, the crooked Mostyn, and Dabreu, the Spanish minister;
two regents, of which one is Lord Chamberlain, the other Groom of the
Stole, and the wife of a Secretary of State. This being <i>sur un assez
bon ton</i> for a player. Don't you want to ask me how I liked him? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
like <i>her</i> exceedingly; her behaviour is all sense, and all sweetness,
too." In 1770, Mrs Delany, Queen Charlotte's friend, visited Garrick's
house at Hampton, and recorded her appreciation of its hostess: "As
to Mrs Garrick, the more one sees her, the better one must like her;
she seems <i>never</i> to depart from a perfect propriety of behaviour,
accompanied with good sense and gentleness of manners." In her
widowhood, she twice refused the hand in marriage of Lord Monboddo, the
Scottish judge, and author of <i>The Origin of Language</i>. Dr Doran says
that Mrs Garrick held her own at the Bishop of London's table, "against
the clever men and women who held controversy under Porteus's roof."</p>

<p>This gentle lady, by a codicil to her will, dated August 15, in the
year of her death, made a most interesting bequest: "I give to Mrs
Siddons a pair of gloves which were Shakespeare's, and were presented
by one of his family to my late dear husband, during the jubilee at
Stratford-upon-Avon." Information of this bequest was conveyed to the
great actress, with this note from Mrs Garrick's executors:&mdash;</p>

<p>This connecting link between Shakespeare, Garrick, and Sarah Siddons is
one of the most interesting incidents in connection with the Adelphi.
Garrick is also responsible for a side-light on the life of Oliver
Goldsmith. Forster, in his <i>Life and Times of Goldsmith</i>, says that the
alteration of his first comedy for Garrick, even upon Garrick's own
conditions, seems to have suddenly occurred to the impecunious author
as a means of raising money. Goldsmith's two letters on the subject
by chance survived and were transcribed by Forster, who, in regard
to the first one, says that: "As well in the manner as in the matter
of it, the writer's distress is very painfully visible. It has every
appearance, even to the wafer hastily thrust into it, of having been
the sudden suggestion of necessity; it is addressed without date<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> or
place to the Adelphi; nor is it unlikely to have been delivered there
by the messenger of a sponging-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your saying you would play my <i>Good-Natured

pound, for which I will give you Newbery's note, so that the whole of
my debt will be an hundred, for which you shall have Newbery's note as
a security. This may be paid either from my alteration if my benefit
should come to so much, but at any rate I will take care you shall not
be a loser. I will give you a new character in my comedy and knock out

<p>"This letter is indorsed in Garrick's handwriting as '<i>Goldsmith's

sympathy or confidence, and the sacrifice of Lofty had come too late
and been too reluctant, Garrick's answer, begged so earnestly, was
not unfavourable. He evaded the altered comedy; spoke of the new one
already mentioned between them; and offered the money required on
Goldsmith's own acceptance.... The second note exhibits such manifest
improvement in the writing as a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> removal of a sore anxiety
might occasion; but the writer's usual epistolary neatness is still
absent. It is hastily folded up in three-cornered shape, is also sealed
with wafer, and also indorsed by Garrick, '<i>Goldsmith's parlaver</i>.'</p>

would not take up Newbery's note, but let Waller' [probably a mistake
for Wallis, Garrick's solicitor] 'tease him, without, however, coming
to extremities; let him haggle after him and he will get it. He owes
it and will pay it. I'm sorry you are ill. I will draw upon you

<p>A final reminiscence of Garrick and this neighbourhood shows the
actor soliciting the Adam brothers on behalf of Andrew Becket, who,
when the Adelphi was being erected, had a bookseller's shop in the
Strand. He was the son of Thomas Becket, the Pall Mall bookseller,
whose establishment was frequented by Garrick. He must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> been
a precocious youth, for, at the age of fourteen, he had written a
comedy founded on Rousseau's <i>Emile</i>, and a poem entitled <i>Theodosius
and Constantia</i>. Born in 1749, he died in 1843. He was a frequent
contributor to the chief magazines of his day. He had a great grievance
against Ralph Griffiths, the proprietor of the <i>Monthly Review</i>,

<p class="caption"> ST MARY ROUNCEVAL (THE ORIGINAL SITE OF NORTHUMBERLAND
HOUSE).</p>

<p>Garrick besought the corner house of Adam Street for his friend, a
request that was granted. He asked for this "corner blessing," and
addressed the architects as his "dear Adelphi." The house was No. 73
Strand, at the north-east corner of Adam Street. It was destroyed by
fire on June 28, 1822, but rebuilt according to the original plan.
Garrick, in the course of his letter to the Adams, said: "Pray, my dear
and very good friends, think a little of this matter, and if you can
make us happy, by suiting all our conveniences, we shall make his shop,
as old Jacob Tonson's was formerly, the rendezvous of the first people
in England. I have a little selfishness in this request&mdash;I never go
to a coffee-house, seldom to taverns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> and should constantly (if this
action takes place) be at Becket's at one at noon and six at night."
Garrick, no doubt, meant what he said, but there is no trace of his
having visited Andrew Becket in this "corner blessing." The shop is now
occupied by a firm of silversmiths.</p>

<p>Samuel Foote, who hated Garrick, is said to have related a story in
which I have little faith. But, as it concerns the great actor and the
Adelphi, I give it for what it is worth. "Garrick," said Foote, "lately
invited Hurd to dine with him in the Adelphi, and after dinner, the
evening being very warm, they walked up and down in front of the house.
As they passed and repassed the dining-room windows, Garrick was in a
perfect agony, for he saw that there was a thief in one of the candles
which was burning on one of the tables; and yet Hurd was a person of
such consequence that he could not run away from him to prevent the
waste of his tallow." This story was put into print by Samuel Rogers,
who was a boy of sixteen at the time of Garrick's death. Foote died in
1777, when Richard Hurd was Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Adelphi has had its share of quacks, the most impudent of
them all being Dr Graham, a Scotchman, who flourished here from the
summer of 1780 until the May following, when he migrated to Pall Mall.
He occupied the middle house in Adelphi Terrace, and in this place Emma
Lyon&mdash;afterwards Lady Hamilton&mdash;posed as the Goddess of Health. James
Graham was then approaching the end of his extraordinary career, for,
born in the Cowgate, Edinburgh, on June 23, 1745, he died in 1794.
Although he studied medicine in the University of Edinburgh, it is not
certain that he took his degree, for, so late as 1783, he is described
as "the person calling himself Dr Graham." He passed his earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> life
in Pontrefact, being married there in 1770. Subsequently, he travelled
in America, as an oculist and aurist. Returning to England in 1774, he
practised at Bristol and Bath, and, a year later, established himself
in Pall Mall, nearly opposite St James's Palace. At Bath, in 1777, he
met Catherine Macaulay, who, a few months later, married his younger
brother, William. Through his treatment of her, he declared, he made
his first real start in life. Be this as it may, he gained the ear of
the public about this time, although he was denounced as a quack by the
medical profession. After a visit to the continent, during which he
received many testimonials from people in the first rank of society, he
came to the Adelphi in 1779. His house and apparatus, it was stated,
cost him 10,000. The entrance hall was adorned with crutches which
had been discarded by his "patients," and, in the rooms above, were
large, gaudily-decorated electrical machines, glass globes, marble
statues, and figures of dragons; the windows were of stained glass, and
the air was laden with the perfume of incense. The door was guarded by
huge footmen. One apartment was devoted to Apollo, and contained "a
magnificent temple, sacred to health." He lectured at enormous prices
and obtained fabulous sums for his quack remedies. For a night in the
"celestial bed," which ensured a beautiful progeny, his fee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> was 100;
his "elixir of life" brought him a fee of one thousand pounds, but his
"earth-bath" was only a modest guinea, while a magneto-electric bed
could be slept in for 50 a night.</p>

<p>In August, 1780, Horace Walpole visited "The Temple of Health" in the
Adelphi, and pronounced it "the most impudent puppet-show of imposition
I ever saw, and the mountebank himself the dullest of his profession,
except that he makes spectators pay a crown apiece for admission only."
The place acquired notoriety so rapidly that, on September 2, George
Colman, the elder, produced at the Haymarket Theatre a skit entitled
<i>The Genius of Nonsense</i>, in which John Bannister, in the character
of the Emperor of Quacks, mimicked Graham. "His satin sofas on glass
legs, his celestial bed, his two porters in long, tawdry greatcoats and
immense gold-laced cocked hats, distributing handbills at the door,
while his goddess of health was dying of a sore throat from squalling
songs at the top of the staircase, were all hit off by a speaking
harlequin, who also caricatured the doctor's sliding walk and bobbing
bows."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The impostor was prevented from buying the "bill of the
play," a burlesque on his own handbill, so that he could not bring an
action for libel.</p>

<p>In another announcement he stated that "Vestina, the Rosy Goddess of
Health, presides at the <i>evening lectures</i> at the Temple of Health,
Adelphi, assisting at the display of the Celestial Meteors, and of that
sacred Vital <i>Fire</i> over which she watches, and whose application in
the <i>Cure of Diseases</i> she daily has the honour of directing." Graham's
"Rosy Goddess of Health" was Emma Lyon, who, in the winter of 1780,
when she posed in the Adelphi, was barely twenty years of age. Young
as she was, she had lived a strange life, even then. The daughter of
a Cheshire blacksmith, she was quite a child when, in the capacity of
nurse-maid, she entered the service of Mrs Thomas, wife of a surgeon
practising at Hawarden; and she can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> hardly have been more than
fifteen or sixteen years of age when she first came to London. "Here,
for a short time, she is said to have been in service: first, with
Mrs Linley, of Drury Lane Theatre; secondly, with Dr Budd, one of the
physicians of St Bartholomew's Hospital; and finally at a fruiterer's
in St James's Market. One of the customers at this shop, 'a lady of
fashion,' attracted by the girl's manner, her beautiful face, and her
wonderful auburn hair, engaged her in the capacity of companion. But,
fortunate as the change at this time may have appeared to her, it
speedily put an end to her opportunities of earning an honest living.
No long time after, we hear of her as living for a time with Captain
(afterwards Admiral) John Willett Payne, who is by some surmised to
be the father of a girl to whom she gave birth about the end of 1779
or the beginning of 1780. However this may be, it is certain that,
before she had completed her seventeenth year, she did give birth to a
child, and that, as soon as possible, it was transferred to the care
of her old grandmother at Hawarden."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Her poverty drove her to
the quack doctor of the Adelphi. Soon after her appearance here, she
"kept house," in extravagant fashion, for Sir Harry Fetherstonshaugh,
"a dissolute baronet," at Up Park, Sussex, and became "a daring and
accomplished horse-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>woman." At this time she called herself Emma Hart,
but on her marriage, in 1791, to Sir William Hamilton, she signed the
register as Amy Lyon. The subsequent career of Nelson's Lady Hamilton
is too well known for repetition.</p>

<p class="caption">SUFFOLK (SUBSEQUENTLY NORTHUMBERLAND) HOUSE.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1781, Graham removed from the comparative quiet of
the Adelphi to more aristocratic quarters in Schomberg House&mdash;part of
the existing War Office&mdash;in Pall Mall. His charges were slightly lower
than in the Adelphi, the use of his "celestial bed" costing but fifty
pounds. In November, 1782, his property was seized for debt, and was
advertised for sale on December 20, and the following days. He made
his misfortunes an opportunity for advertisement, bought in most of
his goods, and threatened one publication with an action for libel for
having published "an incorrect, mutilated, and nonsensical farrago,
which they impudently and falsely call Dr Graham's celebrated lecture
on generation." In March, 1783, he announced that the "High Priestess
of his Temple delivered lectures to ladies, and that the rosy,
athletic, and truly Gigantic Goddess of Health and of Hymen, on the
Celestial Throne," took part in the lectures. Graham's London career
practically ceased in 1783. Ten years later he described himself, in a
book on earth-bathing, as "formerly sole institutor, proprietor, and
director of the Temple of Health in the Adelphi and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> Pall Mall." His
earth-bathing consisted of remaining without clothing in the earth six
hours at a time, for eight days in succession, and for twelve hours
on the ninth day. In 1791, Graham and a young woman, at Newcastle,
"stripped into their first suits," and "were each interred up to the
chin, their heads beautifully dressed and powdered, appearing not
unlike two fine full-grown cauliflowers."</p>

<p>Graham subsequently became a religious enthusiast, took to opium, and
was confined in his own house in Edinburgh as a lunatic. A few months
before his death, he made an affidavit, in which he stated that from
the last day of December 1792, to January 15, 1793, he neither ate,
drank, nor took anything but cold water, sustaining life by wearing
cut-up turfs against his naked body, and by rubbing his limbs with his
own nervous thereal balsam. He died suddenly at his house, opposite
the Archers' Hall, Edinburgh, on June 23, 1794. Graham, though a quack,
and possibly a madman, was not without some knowledge. He was against
flesh-eating and excess in alcohol, and believed in cold bathing, open
windows, sleeping on mattresses, and other points of severe hygiene;
at one time, he stated, he never ate more than the worth of four or
six pence a day. He asserted that all diseases were caused by wearing
too much clothing, and he wore no woollen clothes. Southey saw this
"half knave, half enthusiast" thrice, once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> in his mud-bath. He says
that latterly Graham "would madden himself with opium, rush into the
streets, and strip himself to clothe the first beggar he met."
<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>At Osborn's Hotel, which still exists, under the name of the Adelphi
Hotel, at the corner of John and Adam Streets, the King and Queen of
the Sandwich Islands died, from small-pox, in 1824. Rhio-Rhio was
the son and successor of the first king, Tamehameha, who placed the
Islands under British protection. The Queen died on July 8. "The
King," said a contemporary print, "in the midst of this deep sorrow
manifests a firmness of mind which has penetrated everybody about him
with a feeling of respect. Though very anxious to express his grief in
the manner of his country, and to show the marks of deference which
are usually paid to the dead there, he submits, with good sense and
patience, to every suggestion which our habits dictate." The King died,
at the same place, on September 14. The visit of King Tamehameha and
his consort to England gave rise to the popular song, "The King of
the Cannibal Islands." This hotel was originally called "The Adelphi
New Tavern and Coffee-House," and was opened in October, 1777, "being
completely fitted up in the most elegant and convenient manner for
the entertainment of noblemen and gentlemen." Gibbon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> writing to
Lord Sheffield on August 8, 1787, from the Adelphi Hotel, imparts a
piece of "Intelligence extraordinary. This day (August the seventh)
the celebrated E.G. arrived with a numerous retinue (one servant).
We hear that he has brought over from Lausanne the remainder of his
<i>History</i> for immediate publication." In 1813, George Crabbe, the
poet, and his wife stayed in the Adelphi during a visit to London. Dr
Thomas Munro, Turner's patron, resided here, and on April 22, 1827,
Thomas Rowlandson, the famous caricaturist, died here. Isaac D'Israeli,
the author of <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, and father of the Earl of
Beaconsfield, stayed at Osborn's Hotel after his wedding tour, in 1802.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that Benjamin Disraeli was born in the
Adelphi. The authority for this statement is Lord Barrington, who,
during the Earl of Beaconsfield's last illness, questioned him on the
point. "I was born in the Adelphi," was the reply, "and I may say in
a library. My father was not rich when he married. He took a suite
of apartments in the Adelphi, and he possessed a large collection of
books; all the rooms were covered with them, including that in which I
was born." Mr Wheatley, however, says that "careful investigation has
left little doubt that this was not the case, as Isaac D'Israeli had
left the Adelphi"&mdash;where he had a lease of the first floor of No. 2<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
James Street&mdash;"for King's Road (now Theobald's Road) before the birth
of Benjamin."</p>

<p>In James Street, on the second floor of No. 1, there lived and died a
celebrated character, Thomas Hill (1760-1840), the book-collector and
patron of Bloomfield and Kirke White. He was the fussy, good-natured
Hull of Theodore Hook's novel, <i>Gilbert Gurney</i> (1836). More notable
still, he was the original of Paul Pry, in Poole's comedy (1825).
Paul Pry is an idle, inquisitive, meddle-some fellow who, without any
occupation of his own, is for ever thrusting himself upon other people
with the apology, "I hope I don't intrude." John Liston (1776-1846)
was the first stage representative of the character, and the part was
frequently acted by the late John Lawrence Toole. "Tommy" Hill, as he
was familiarly called, always boasted that he had whatever was wanted:
"Cards, sir? Pooh! pooh! Nonsense! thousands of packs in the house."
Planch says of him: "His <i>spcialit</i> was the accurate information he
could impart on all the petty details of the domestic economy of his
friends, the contents of their wardrobes, their pantries, the number
of pots of preserve in their store-closets, and of the table-napkins
in their linen-presses, the dates of their births and marriages,
the amounts of their tradesmen's bills, and whether paid weekly or
quarterly. He had been on the press, and was connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>. He used to drive Mathews crazy by ferreting out
his whereabouts when he left London, and popping the information in
some paper."</p>

<p class="caption">THE STRAND FRONT OF NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE.</p>

<p>Two of the most celebrated literary names connected with the Adelphi
are Thomas Hood and Charles Dickens. Hood, soon after his marriage in
1824, lived in chambers at No. 2 Robert Street, his acquaintanceship
at that time including Charles Lamb, Hazlitt, and De Quincey. His
association with the Adelphi continued until the end of his career, for
his <i>Magazine</i>, established in 1844&mdash;the year before his death&mdash;was
published from No. 1 Adam Street. Dickens knew the Adelphi well. As
a boy he frequented its underground passages, and, later on, he used
Osborn's Hotel (the Adelphi Hotel) for a scene in <i>Pickwick</i>.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
is recording his own experiences when, in <i>David Copperfield</i>, he says:
"I was fond of wandering about the Adelphi, because it was a mysterious
place, with those dark arches. I see myself emerging one evening from
some of these arches, on a little public-house close to the river,
with an open space before it, where some coal-heavers were dancing; to
look at whom, I sat down upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> bench. I wonder what they thought
of me!" This was also the scene of the meeting of the Micawbers and
Copperfield prior to the departure of the impecunious Wilkins for
Australia: "The Micawber family were lodged in a little, dirty,
tumble-down public-house, which in those days was close to the stairs,
and where protruding wooden rooms over-hung the river. The family, as
emigrants, being objects of some interest in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> about Hungerford,
attracted so many beholders, that we were glad to take refuge in their
room. It was one of the wooden chambers upstairs, with the tide flowing
underneath.... I went down again next morning to see that they were
away. They had departed, in a boat, as early as five o'clock. It was a
wonderful instance to me of the gap such partings make, that although
my association of them with the tumble-down public-house and the wooden
stairs dated only from last night, both seemed dreary and deserted, now
that they were gone."
<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
<p>This "little, dirty, tumble-down public-house" of Dickens was the
"Fox-under-the-Hill." It stood at the bottom of Ivy Lane. The
ram-shackle building disappeared with the formation of the Victoria
Embankment and Gardens, but the passage in question still remains,
and, although it is not noticed by the thousands of people who walk by
it daily, Ivy Lane is one of the most interesting bits of old London.
Stow, in his <i>Survey</i>, alludes to it thus: "Ivy Bridge, in the High
Street, which had a way under it leading to the Thames, the like
as sometime had the Strand Bridge, is now taken down, but the lane
remaineth as afore; or better, and parteth the liberty of the Duchy
(of Lancaster) and the city of Westminster on that south-side." Strype
adds that the lane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> was "very bad and almost impassable." As it was
very narrow, and the descent was steep, its inconvenience is easily
understood. The passage is still here, but, at the river end, it is
enclosed by gates. Ivy Bridge, or Pier, was the landing-place for the
halfpenny steamboats which plied between the Strand and London Bridge.
Here a lamentable explosion, by which many people were killed, occurred
in August, 1847, on the <i>Cricket</i>, and, soon afterwards, the "Fox"
landing-stage was disused.</p>

<p>From the "Fox-under-the-Hill" it is an easy transition to the
"dark arches" which made such an impression on the mind of Charles
Dickens. They form a small town in themselves, and although tenanted
by wine-merchants, and other law-abiding people, they are still
"mysterious" enough to strike one with wonderment that such a dreary
spot can exist within hail of the busy Strand. "The Adelphi arches,
many of which are used for cellars and coal-wharves," wrote John Timbs,
half a century ago, "remind us, in their grim vastness, of the Etruscan
cloaca of ancient Rome. Beneath the 'dark arches,' as they were (and
are) called, the most abandoned characters used to lurk; outcasts and
vagrants came there to sleep; and many a street-thief escaped from his
pursuers, before the introduction of gas-lights and a vigilant police.
Even now tramps prowl in a ghastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> manner down the dim-lit passages."
The condition of things has not changed much during these fifty years,
and a stranger would be well-advised in not venturing on a voyage of
discovery through this strange region, alone. Augustus Egg placed the
scene of one of his most tragic pictures on the banks of the river by
the Adelphi arches. In these caverns a battery of guns was held in
readiness in connection with the great Chartist meeting, on Kennington
Common, on April 10, 1848. The piers on which the arches rest having
shown signs of insecurity, the entire structure was underpinned, and
strengthened in other ways, in the years 1872-4.</p>

<p>The Adelphi arches were a source of wonderment to Londoners in the
middle of the last century. Thomas Miller, the poet and novelist,
writing in 1850, gives a vivid description of them: "Thousands who pass
along the Strand never dream of the shadowy region which lies between
them and the river&mdash;the black-browed arches that span right and left,
before and behind, covering many a rood of ground on which the rain
never beats, nor the sunbeam sleeps, and at the entrance of which the
wind only seems to howl and whine, as if afraid of venturing further
into the darkness. Many of our readers will, no doubt, conclude that
such a dreary place as this must be deserted and tenantless: such is
not the case. Here many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> those strong horses, which the countryman
who visits London looks upon with wonder and envy, are stabled&mdash;strong,
broad-chested steeds, such as may be seen dragging the heavily-laden
coal-waggons up those steep passages which lead into the Strand, and
which seem 'to the manner born.'</p>

<p>"Cows are also kept here, which, rumour says, never saw any other light
beyond that of the gas which gleams through their prison-bars, or, by
way of change, the cheering rays from a lantern, when they are milked
or fed; that here many of them were calved, and have lived on, giving
milk to a good old age&mdash;buried like the main-pipe that supplies us with
water and finds its way into our houses without our once enquiring
how. We have often pitied the London cows, which we have seen driven
up one street and down another, and have fancied that what little milk
they had must have been churned into indifferent butter, as they ran
on, to escape the stones thrown after them by boys, while mongrels
were ever sallying out, and either biting or barking at their heels;
but we had not seen those which are doomed to dwell in the unbroken
darkness of the Adelphi arches, without ever breathing any other than
the sepulchral air which stagnates this murky purgatory. Assuredly they
ought to be taken out for a little fresh air now and then, and be led
by the horns to</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;" >
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Fresh fields and pastures new';</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>for we can readily conceive how pleased and patiently they would go
'blinking' along, compared to those horned blackguards who come with a
butt and a 'boo' at us as they return from Smithfield, and, before we
have time to say 'Now, stupid!' pitch us over the battlements of one of
the bridges, and leave us to sink or swim.</p>

<p>"The Adelphi arches form a little subterranean city; there is nothing
like it in England: in some places you catch a glimpse of the river,
a small loop-hole that lets in the light like the end of a railway
tunnel, yet seeming to diminish more than these tunnels, on account of
the steep descent, until one of the steamers, in passing, appears to
fill up the opening like a half-closed door. Beside these arches there
are narrow passages which go dipping down to the water-side, where on
either hand houses stand looking at one another in the openings between
the darkness. There is a dismal and solitary look about these tall
imprisoned houses; you cannot conceive how they are entered, for there
appears to be no way to them, and you conclude that they are empty. Or,
if they are inhabited, you wonder if the people ever look out of those
dim, dirt-ditched windows at the dead-looking walls opposite. We have
turned back, and hunted up and down looking from below, but nowhere
could we obtain a view of the entrance to those murderous-looking
houses. We once saw a butterfly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> which had lost its way, and got into
the little light which had stolen out to look at the entrance of these
arches: it went up and down, and hither and thither, seeming to become
feebler every moment, as if it had given up all hope of ever swinging
with folded wings, like a pea-bloom, on the flowers again, and we
doubted not but that it found a grave amid the green decay of some
rotten water-butt." The cows have disappeared, and the muddy wharves
have been replaced by pleasant gardens and the busy hum of workshops,
but the "subterranean city" is likely to exist in its present form for
many years to come. The embankment, the construction of which involved
the abolition of the Adelphi wharves, was opened in 1870 by the Prince
of Wales (Edward VII.), as the representative of Queen Victoria. This
magnificent example of engineering was begun in 1862, and the cost was
about 2,000,000.</p>

family had apartments in the Adelphi Hotel. There Dickens laid the
scene of one of his best chapters: "Driving to the George and Vulture,
they found that Arabella and her maid had sent for a hackney-coach
immediately on the receipt of a short note from Emily announcing her
arrival in town, and had proceeded straight to the Adelphi. As Wardle
had business to transact in the city, they sent the carriage and the
fat boy to his hotel, with the information that he and Mr Pickwick
would return together to dinner at five o'clock.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"Now, whether the shake had jumbled the fat boy's faculties together,
instead of arranging them in proper order, or had roused such a
quantity of new ideas within him as to render him oblivious of
ordinary forms and ceremonies, or (which is also possible) had proved
unsuccessful in preventing his falling asleep as he ascended the
stairs, it is an undoubted fact that he walked into the sitting-room
without previously knocking at the door, and so beheld a gentleman with
his arm clasping his young mistress's waist, sitting very lovingly by
her side on a sofa, while Arabella and her pretty handmaid feigned to
be absorbed in looking out of a window at the other end of the room.
At sight of which phenomenon the fat boy uttered an interjection, the
ladies a scream, and the gentleman an oath, almost simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
"'Wretched creature! what do you want here?' said the gentleman, who,
it is needless to say, was Mr Snodgrass.
</p>
<p>
"To this the fat boy, considerably terrified, briefly responded,
'Missis.'
</p>
<p>
"'What do you want me for?' inquired Emily, turning her head aside;
'you stupid creature.'
</p>
<p>
"'Master and Mr Pickwick is going to dine here at five,' replied the
fat boy.
</p>
<p>
"'Leave the room!' said Mr Snodgrass, glaring upon the bewildered youth.
</p>
<p>
"'No, no, no!' added Emily, hastily. 'Bella, dear, advise me.'
</p>
<p>
"Upon this, Emily and Mr Snodgrass, and Arabella and Mary, crowded into
a corner and conversed earnestly in whispers for some minutes, during
which the fat boy dozed.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
"There was so much to say upstairs, and there were so many plans
to concert for elopement and matrimony in the event of old Wardle
continuing to be cruel, that it wanted only half an hour to dinner when
Mr Snodgrass took his final adieu. The ladies ran to Emily's bedroom
to dress, and the lover, taking up his hat, walked out of the room. He
had scarcely got outside the door when he heard Wardle's voice talking
loudly; and looking over the banisters, beheld him, followed by some
other gentlemen, coming straight upstairs. Knowing nothing of the
house, Mr Snodgrass in his confusion stepped hastily back into the room
he had just quitted, and passing from thence into an inner apartment
(Mr Wardle's bed-chamber), closed the door softly, just as the persons
he had caught a glimpse of entered the sitting-room. These were Mr
Wardle and Mr Pickwick, Mr Nathaniel Winkle, and Mr Benjamin Allen,
whom he had no difficulty in recognising by their voices.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>
"The wine came, and Perker came upstairs at the same moment. Mr
Snodgrass had dinner at a side-table, and, when he had dispatched it,
drew his chair next Emily, without the smallest opposition on the old
gentleman's part.
</p>
<p>
"The evening was excellent. Little Mr Perker came out wonderfully,
told various comic stories, and sang a serious song, which was almost
as funny as the anecdotes. Arabella was very charming, Mr Wardle very
jovial, Mr Pickwick very harmonious, Mr Ben Allen very uproarious, the
lovers very silent, Mr Winkle very talkative, and all of them very
happy."&mdash;<i>The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club</i>, chap. liv.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen Elizabeth</span> "was particularly kind to the citizens, and
borrowed money of them on all occasions." At first sight this may not
seem a compliment, since monarchs have not always been too particular
in the matter of the repayment of their loans. Queen Elizabeth,
however, was a good borrower, and the Goldsmiths Company&mdash;employed by
her in these transactions&mdash;drank annual libations to her memory, out
of a silver cup which she had presented to them, for many years after
her decease. But "the business of goldsmiths," as Pennant has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> pointed
out, "was confined to the buying and selling of plate, and foreign
coins of gold and silver, melting them, and coining others at the
mint. The banking was accidental, and foreign to their institution.
Regular banking by private people resulted, in 1643, from the calamity
of the time, when the seditious spirit was incited by the arts of the
parliamentary leaders. The merchants and tradesmen, who before trusted
their cash to their servants and apprentices, found that no longer
safe; neither did they dare to leave it in the mint at the Tower, by
reason of the distress of Majesty itself, which before was a place of
public deposit." In the year 1645, the goldsmiths added banking to
their business. The first regular banker was Thomas Child, goldsmith,
of Fleet Street, who began in this way soon after the Restoration. "He
was the father of the profession, a person of large fortune and most
respectable character."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The shops of the goldsmiths and bankers were, of course, situated in
the city of London until, in 1692, the firm of Middleton &amp; Campbell was
established in St Martin's Lane. George Middleton and John Campbell
were the predecessors of the great banking firm known as Coutts &amp;
Co.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> whose premises in the Strand occupied part of the New Exchange
and the Adelphi for one hundred and sixty odd years. Campbell, who
died in 1712, and was buried in the churchyard of St Paul's, Covent
Garden, left his "faithful and honest partner" as executor to his four
children until the coming of age of his eldest son, William. In 1729,
the youngest son of John Campbell became a partner. Until 1737, the
business was carried on in St Martin's Lane, then the centre of the
artistic world of London. In that year Messrs Middleton &amp; Campbell
occupied the middle house of a row of eleven which had been built on
the site of "Britain's Burse." The firm did not become "bankers" until
1740, although it had transacted the usual banking business, together
with an army and commission agency, for many years previously. In
1712-13 Middleton &amp; Campbell had acted as agents for Queen Anne's 4th
Troop of Guards. The name of the firm was changed to that of Coutts in
1760, and it is by this honoured name that it is likely to be known
so long as it exists&mdash;and that will be so long as banking flourishes
as an institution in this country. The original sign of the house,
three crowns, is still used on the cheques, surrounded by the words:
"At the Three Crowns in the Strand, next door to the Globe Tavern,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1692."</p>

<p>The story of the change in the name of the firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> is curious and
interesting. This history being more particularly concerned with Thomas
Coutts, and his establishment in the Strand, it is not necessary to go
further into his genealogy than to state that the great banker was a
descendant of William Coutts and his wife, Janet Ochiltree, of Montrose.</p>

<p>One Patrick Coutts, desirous of making a name for himself, left
Montrose and went to Edinburgh, where he traded as a general merchant,
importing and exporting goods, in 1696. He died in 1704, a man of
probity and wealth. He left his great fortune to his son John, who
also flourished in Edinburgh as a merchant. "The business initiated by
John Coutts was a combination of general dealing and the negotiation
of foreign bills of exchange. He also imported and sold corn, either
on his own account or as a commission agent. But in proportion as
he advanced in business and acquired spare capital, as well as the
confidence of persons who deposited with him money at interest, he
appears to have laid himself out chiefly as a negotiator of bills, a
species of traffic which as yet had not been appropriated by banks, and
demanded much knowledge and shrewdness. Whether from family connections
or otherwise, he became acquainted with people of good social standing,
through whom he widened his base of operations. For some time he had
for a partner Thomas Haliburton, of Newmains (who through a daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
became the great-grandfather of Sir Walter Scott); next we find him
taking as partner Archibald Trotter, son of Trotter, of Castleshiel;
then by another change of firm he was associated with his cousin,
Robert Ramsay, brother of Sir Alexander, of Balmain. As further
marking the esteem in which he was held by the aristocratic circles of
Edinburgh, he formed an intimacy with Sir John Stuart, of Allanbank,
whose sister he married."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>John Coutts, who was Provost of Edinburgh in 1742-43, died in 1751,
leaving four sons, Patrick, John, James, and Thomas, who inherited
his business and great wealth. Thomas Coutts, with whom we are more
directly concerned, was born on September 7, 1735. Patrick and Thomas
Coutts, and their cousin, Thomas Stephen, opened a branch establishment
in London, in Jeffrey's Square, St Mary Axe, under the name of Coutts,
Stephen, Coutts, &amp; Co.; John and James Coutts, remaining in the North,
acted as the correspondents of the London firm, and bought and sold
goods on commission. In his <i>Memoirs of a Banking House</i>, Sir William
Forbes says: "Some years they made large profits, which they as often
lost in others, owing to the fluctuation of the markets and the
bankruptcy of many of those with whom they dealt. Indeed, I have often
thought it not a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> singular that a banking house, which of all
branches of business seems peculiarly to require caution, and which
ought, as much as possible, to be kept clear of hazard or speculation,
should have chosen to embark so largely in the corn trade, which is
perhaps the most liable to sudden fluctuation, and in which no human
prudence or insurance can guard the adventures from frequent loss."</p>

<p>The house in the Strand was carried on under the style of Campbell &amp;
Bruce, under the sole control of George Campbell from 1751 to July,
1755. James Coutts, the third son of Lord Provost John Coutts, having
become acquainted with George Campbell during one of his visits to
London&mdash;for his main business was with the Edinburgh house&mdash;married, in
1754, Campbell's niece, Mary Peagrim, and was taken into partnership
by the Strand banker, whereupon he withdrew from his old firm, and
Campbell &amp; Coutts came into existence at No. 59 Strand. On the death of
his partner, in 1761, James Coutts took his brother, Thomas, into the
firm. James Coutts died in 1778, leaving Thomas in full control of the
business, and his only daughter inherited his fortune of 70,000.</p>

<p>Thomas Coutts, who ultimately became known as "the richest man in
London," was a great character. He had received an excellent training
at the High School in Edinburgh, and this, together with his vast
experience in correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> "enabled him to appreciate literary
composition, and to express himself with accuracy." He survived all
his brothers, and became the first banker in London. His munificence,
no less than his wealth, admitted him to the highest circles. Together
with Sir Walter Scott, his friend, and kinsman, through the Stuarts of
Allanbank, he received the freedom of the city of Edinburgh. Although
he was always ready to lend a hand to genuine distress, he was very
keen in money matters, and sternly resented any attempt at what he
considered imposition. The following letter, written in his eightieth
year, is characteristic of his attitude when replying to those who
besought unwarranted favours. It was addressed to John Pinkerton, the
Scottish antiquary and historian, who had asked the banker to recommend
him as a travelling companion, and to forego the interest on a bond:&mdash;</p>



<p style="margin-left: 45%;">
"<span class="smcap">Strand</span>, <i>January 31, 1815</i>.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have received the favour of your letter, asking me to withdraw
the claim for interest on the sum I lent on the security of a house;
but the footing upon which you have put the request is one I have
uniformly, at all times, thought to be such as I ought to reject, and
have rejected accordingly. The bankers in Scotland and the county
banks in England are on a different plan from those of London. They
circulate their own notes and make pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>ments in them. We give out no
notes of our own, and if we were to give interest at even one per
cent. per annum, we should be losers by our business.</p>

<p>"We do not consider ourselves as being obliged to any one person who
places his money in our hands, however considerable. It is to the
aggregate and general mass of society that we owe our situation, and
to the credit our prudence and attention has obtained for us; and
people deposit their money in our hands for their own advantage and
convenience, not from favour to us, nor do we desire to have it on any
other terms. Probably you may not understand the explanation I have
spent time in making, which I can very ill spare, and it may therefore
answer no purpose, but it satisfies myself, and I wish to show equal
attention to all my employers, whether they have large or small sums
in my hands, which indeed hardly ever occupies my attention.</p>

<p>"My attention is fully engrossed in doing business with honour and
regularity, leaving the rest to the common chance and course of
things. It surprises me that, though it every day appears that there
is very little truth published in the newspapers, yet people will
still believe what they read, especially abuse, or what they think is
against the character or prudence of the person treated of. I saw some
paragraphs, and heard of more, of what I had done for Mr Kean, in all
which there was not a word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> truth; though I see no reason why I
might not, without offence to any one, have given Mr Kean anything I
pleased. In doing any little matter in my power for an individual, I
must add, I never had any view to celebrity, with the present age or
with posterity.</p>

<p>"If I should know of any gentleman wanting a travelling companion
abroad, I shall mention you to him, but it seldom happens that I am
applied to in such matters."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Mr Kean alluded to in this letter is, of course, the great actor.
But, as Edmund Kean was at the zenith of his power and success in
1814-15, we may indeed readily believe that "there was not a word of
truth" in the rumour that "Mrs Coutts visited Kean and made him a gift
of fifty pounds," which was circulated at the time. Moreover, it was
not until March 2, 1815, that the marriage of Thomas Coutts to Harriot
Mellon was announced. Miss Mellon was the second wife of the banker,
and her marriage was a romantic one. Before dealing with it, however,
it is necessary to refer to the first Mrs Coutts, about whom a good
deal of mystery has been made. The simple truth is that she came of
"poor but honest parents" in Lancashire. Her name was Susan Starkie,
and we have it on the authority of the Earl of Dundonald (1775-1860)
that she was "a most respectable, modest, handsome young woman."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Another writer says that, even near the day of her death, although she
was then an old woman, with grown-up grandchildren, "she exhibited
traces of having possessed some personal advantages in her youth, her
large black eyes retaining their brightness, although rather stern
and wild in their expression." She is interesting, as far as this
story is concerned, inasmuch as Thomas Coutts met her in the house in
the Strand, where she was in charge of his brother's daughter. After
the marriage, Mr and Mrs Thomas Coutts resided in St Martin's Lane,
and there "my brother and myself have frequently called to visit"
them, wrote the Earl of Dundonald, who added that "her good sense,
amiable disposition, and exemplary good conduct endeared her to all
her husband's family, and commanded the respect of everyone who knew
her." Of this union there were three daughters, who were known as "the
Three Graces." The first, Susan, married the third Earl of Guildford;
the second, Frances, was the second wife of John, first Marquis of
Bute; while Sophia was married to Sir Francis Burdett, Bart., M.P.,
the well-known politician, and hero of reform. Sir Francis and Lady
Burdett had six children, a son and five daughters, the youngest of
whom, Angela Georgina, born on April 21, 1814, became the Baroness
Burdett-Coutts, whose death, on December 30, 1906, has been so greatly
deplored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> This lady received, on the death of the Duchess of St
Albans&mdash;Harriot Mellon, the second wife of Thomas Coutts&mdash;the entire
estate which the banker had, by his will, placed at the disposal of the
Duchess.</p>

<p>The Duchess of St Albans, who, as Mrs Coutts, must have been a frequent
visitor at No. 59 Strand, made her first appearance on the stage
as Lydia Languish in <i>The Rivals</i>, on January 31, 1795, at Covent
Garden, she being then twenty years of age. Her first husband died
on February 24, 1822, and was buried at Wroxton Abbey, Oxfordshire,
"his funeral being attended by many of the nobility and gentry of the
district, while the carriages of their royal highnesses the Dukes of
York, Clarence, and Sussex accompanied the procession." She was then
importuned by William Aubrey de Vere, the ninth Duke of St Albans, to
whom she was married on June 16, 1827. The story of this courtship
has been told by Sir Walter Scott: "Mrs Coutts, with the Duke of St
Albans and Lady Charlotte Beauclerk, called to take leave of us. When
at Abbotsford his suit throve but coldly. She made me, I believe, a
confidant in sincerity. She had refused him twice, and decidedly: he
was merely on the footing of friendship. I urged it was akin to love.
She allowed she might marry the Duke, only she had at present not the
least intention that way. It is the fashion to attend Mrs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> Coutts'
parties, and to abuse her. I have always found her a kind, friendly
woman, without either affectation or insolence in the display of her
wealth; most willing to do good if the means be shown her. She can be
very entertaining too, and she speaks without scruple of her stage
life. So much wealth can hardly be enjoyed without ostentation." In
Lockhart's <i>Life of Scott</i> there is a long account of a visit paid to
Sir Walter by Mrs Coutts, who arrived at Abbotsford with a train of
three carriages each drawn by four horses. Her retinue consisted of
her future lord, the Duke of St Albans, one of his grace's sisters,
a sort of lady-in-waiting, two physicians, and besides other menials
of every grade, two bed-chamber women for Mrs Coutts' own person&mdash;she
requiring to have this article also in duplicate, because in her
widowed condition she was fearful of ghosts. There were already
assembled at Abbotsford several ladies of high rank, who, witnessing
this ostentation on the part of an actress who, when a girl, had been
chased from her home by a vulgar virago of a mother, took it into
their heads to snub her. "The good-natured Sir Walter, pained at the
conduct of his noble guests, took the youngest and prettiest of them
aside, and lectured her on her manners. The beautiful peeress thanked
him for treating her as his daughter; and one by one the other ladies
being made to run the gauntlet of Sir Walter's rebukes, Mrs Coutts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
was speedily set at ease. The narrative is curious as a typical
illustration of the sentiments with which the society to which Harriet
Mellon claimed to belong regarded her."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The anecdotes which have been related of Thomas Coutts are innumerable
and&mdash;unreliable. One of the most extraordinary of them is the
following:&mdash;"In the early part of his career, Mr Coutts, anxious
to secure the cordial co-operation of the heads of the various
banking-houses in London, was in the habit of frequently inviting them
to dinner. On one of these occasions the manager of a City bank, in
retailing the news of the day, accidentally remarked that a certain
nobleman had applied to his firm for the loan of 30,000, and had been
refused. Mr Coutts listened, and said nothing; but the moment his
guests had retired, about ten o'clock in the evening, he started off
to the house of the nobleman mentioned, and requested the honour of an
interview with his lordship next day. On the following morning, the
nobleman called at the bank. Mr Coutts received him with the greatest
politeness, and taking thirty one-thousand pound notes from a drawer,
presented them to his lordship. The latter, very agreeably surprised,
exclaimed, 'But what security am I to give you?' 'I shall be satisfied
with your lordship's note of hand,' was the reply. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> 'I.O.U.' was
instantly given, with the remark, 'I find I shall only require for the
present 10,000; I therefore return you 20,000, with which you will be
pleased to open an account in my name.' This generous, or, as it may
more truly be called, exceedingly well-calculated, act of Mr Coutts
was not lost upon the nobleman, who, in addition to paying in within
a few months 200,000 to his account, the produce of the sale of an
estate, recommended several high personages to patronise the bank in
the Strand. Among new clients who opened accounts there was King George
III."</p>

<p>This absurd story had its origin in the financial adventures of one
Alexander Trotter, Paymaster of the Navy, who, despite the facts that
his salary was a mere five hundred a year and that he had no other
means, passed some fifteen million pounds through Coutts' Bank and
speculated hugely on the Stock Exchange, his transactions amounting
in one day to 300,000. In giving evidence in the trial of Lord
Melville, the treasurer of the Navy, in 1806, he said: "I certainly
made use of that part which was not likely to be claimed for my own
benefit, generally by lending it at interest, and at times by investing
it in Exchequer or Navy Bills, or other Government securities. The
whole profit and emolument derived from that mode of laying out the
money were entirely my own." He gave as his reason for passing the
money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> through his private account, instead of through the Bank of
England, that, after the removal of the Navy Office from Broad Street
to Somerset Place, it was "safer and more convenient to give orders
on a bank in the Strand." He also affirmed that he never drew for
a million of money but once in his life, "And that money went into
the hands of Coutts, for I drew a draft, as usual, upon the Bank of
England, but instead of giving the draft to Coutts, I gave it to a
clerk, who carried it to the bank, and, the notes being divided into a
great number of small notes, he took them to Coutts"&mdash;a very singular
proceeding. Lord Melville stated that, to the best of his recollection,
"He never authorised the application of any of the Navy money for his
own benefit or advantage, but that, owing to the way in which the
pay-master had blended his own money and the public money, it was
impossible to ascertain with precision whether the advances he had made
to the treasurer were from one source or the other." An important point
in the trial turned upon the disposal of a certain sum of 30,000, and
it could not be determined as to whether the money came from the Navy,
or, as a loan, from Messrs Coutts. Hence arose the apocryphal story of
the staid banker, to whom caution was second nature, wishing to lend
this large amount on the frail security of an I.O.U.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the stories about people who are supposed to have given
Thomas Coutts a guinea, as a consequence of his shabby appearance,
they are too numerous for repetition. The most circumstantial is the
following:&mdash;"Mr Coutts used to make periodical visits to a town in the
vicinity of the country seat of one of his married daughters. On one
of these occasions he had attracted the attention of a benevolent old
gentleman, who, noticing the neat but somewhat worn apparel of the
eminent banker, imagined that he had most probably seen better days,
but that his actual financial condition was not very flourishing.
The last time they met was Christmas time; and the benevolent old
gentleman, no doubt warmed up with the prospects of the festivities of
the season, dropped a guinea into the hand of Mr Coutts as he passed
quickly by him, bidding him get a good dinner. Having discovered
the name of his benefactor, Mr Coutts soon after invited him to his
house, where he made himself known to him, and related the anecdote
to his guests, letting them know how he had the guinea given to him,
and saying he intended keeping it." This story of the guinea gathered
strength with the years, one of the versions being that when the banker
was in Brighton, visiting the Prince Regent, to whom he occasionally
acted as financial adviser, he was sitting on the front when a lady,
observing "his dejected appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> and shabby apparel, gave him a
crown with which to get some breakfast, and promised to get her friends
to help to buy him a dinner. The crown, of course, proved to be a crown
token piece issued from the Coutts' Bank at the sign of 'The Three
Crowns in the Strand,' but when the lady returned with her friends,
and was just about to give the poor man his dinner money, the Prince
Regent ran out from the pavilion, and slapping him on the back, called
out, 'Tom Coutts, my boy, we have fined you a bottle for leaving your
glass!'"</p>

</p>
<p class="caption"> NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE, FROM THE GARDENS.</p>

<p>According to Mrs Cornwall Baron-Wilson, Thomas Coutts was "a tall,
thin, spare figure, and his clothes, always ill-fitting, bore that
appearance of being rubbed at the seams, which reveals the 'business
coat' of an office. He was often mistaken for an indigent person,
and used to enjoy the mistake of all things." There is probably
some little exaggeration in this, but the banker, most certainly,
was not extravagant in his dress. Even if the following anecdote is
not strictly accurate, there is, no doubt, some truth in it:&mdash;"Mr
Coutts, from his too strict attention to the bank, felt his appetite
diminished; and, in order to afford him a little exercise, his
physician ordered him to walk daily after the bank closed to a
chemist's, who resided at some distance from the Strand, to have
some tonic preparation made up. So quiet and unassuming was he in
his manners, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> he always made way for everyone who came while
he was at the shop, so that they might be served before him; and,
with his fair, delicate countenance, spare frame, and very simple
dress, no strangers guessed that they were pushing aside the opulent
Mr Coutts. A kind-hearted, liberal man, a merchant&mdash;who used to quit
his counting-house about the same time that Mr Coutts left the bank,
and who had chanced to be in the chemist's shop two or three times at
the hour when the latter came there&mdash;had remarked him, and from his
retiring, gentle appearance and actions, concluded he was a reduced
gentleman whose mind was superior to his means. Accordingly, this
charitable merchant resolved to administer to the necessities of the
shrinking, modest individual; and, one day, having sealed up a sum of
money for the purpose, he went to the chemist's shop, where he remained
a length of time, waiting anxiously for the appearance of the latter,
who, however, on that day did not come for the tonic, being probably
too much engaged in distributing thousands. The stranger, being at
length tired of waiting, and feeling ashamed of occupying a place
in the shop so long, told the chemist how the absence of the pale,
indigent, elderly gentleman had prevented his intended donation. The
chemist, in amazement, said: 'And you really meant to offer pecuniary
aid to that person, sir? Have you no idea who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> he is?' 'None,' said
the other, 'but I conclude he is some gentlemanly man in distressed,
or, at least, reduced circumstances.' 'You shall judge, sir, as to his
circumstances&mdash;that unassuming, quiet individual is Thomas Coutts!'"<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Part of the premises of the bank has been occupied since the removal
of Messrs Coutts&mdash;in 1904, to No. 440 Strand&mdash;by the London County
Council. The number is 59, and the upper part is much the same as it
was in 1768, when it was erected by the brothers Adam. The house then
contained "some good marble chimney-pieces of the Cipriani and Bacon
school. The dining-room is hung with Chinese subjects on paper, sent to
Coutts by Lord Macartney, while on his embassy to China in 1792-95. In
another room is a collection of portraits of the early friends of the
wealthy banker, including the portrait of Dr Armstrong, the poet, by
Sir Joshua Reynolds. The strong rooms, or vaults of the house&mdash;'which
alone cost 10,000'&mdash;will repay an endeavour to obtain a sight of
them. Here, in a succession of cloister-like avenues, are stored in
boxes of all shapes, sizes, and colours, patents, title-deeds, plate,
etc., of many of the nobility and gentry of Great Britain."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The
Adams mantel-pieces and some of their doors were transferred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> No.
440 Strand; and here the board-room&mdash;an apartment of drawing-room
appearance which is in strange contrast to the busy thoroughfare
below&mdash;is hung with the Chinese wall-paper which, despite its hundred
and more years of age, looks perfectly new. During the building of
the Adelphi, Coutts, in order to prevent the interruption of the
view from the back part of the premises, made a stipulation with the
Adams that Robert Street should be so planned as to form a kind of
framework for the fine view of the hills beyond the Thames. The land
beyond John and William streets was then occupied by the strong-rooms,
"connected underground with the office, and built only to the level
of the Strand. When it became necessary to enlarge" the premises,
Coutts "procured a special Act of Parliament for throwing an arch over
William Street. It was recognised as a good omen that, on the day of
opening these improvements, Nelson sent to Mr Coutts for security the
diamond aigrette which had been presented to him by the Sultan."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> In
James Street&mdash;now covered, with William Street, in the general name of
Durham House Street, stretching from the Strand to John Street&mdash;was the
Adelphi Chapel, built by a congregation of Particular Baptists about
1777, and subsequently sold by them to the Calvinistic Baptists. Later
on, an Independent congregation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> occupied the building until it became
absorbed in the banking-house, and, until the removal of Messrs Coutts,
it was called "the chapel."</p>

<p>Many names, famous in all ranks of life, are registered in the accounts
of the customers of Messrs Coutts. Taking them at random, they include
Pitt, Lord Londonderry, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Sir Walter Scott, the Duke
of Wellington, Nelson, Lord Bute, Dr Johnson, C.J. Fox, Lord Grenville,
Lord Macartney, Pope, Benjamin West, Lord George Gordon, Dr Armstrong,
Mrs FitzHerbert, Charles Dickens, Livingstone, Alfred Tennyson, and
Henry Irving. Kings George III. and IV., and William IV., banked here,
as did Queen Victoria. Messrs Coutts are also the bankers of King
Edward VII.&mdash;who also kept an account at No. 59 when he was Prince of
Wales&mdash;of Queen Alexandra, of the Queen of Spain, and of the King of
Portugal.</p>

<p>The partners in the bank are, with the exception of the Hon. W.F.D.
Smith, of Scottish descent. On February 23, 1906, the capital was
registered as 600,000, distributed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thomas Coutts left all his property to his wife. His personal estate
was valued at just under 600,000, but "as his own personal stocks
and shares and his interest in the stocks and shares held by the bank
were mingled, and it would be difficult for others than his partners
to distinguish which was the bank's property and which was his own,
he named as special trustees of such stocks and shares his partners,
Sir Edmund Antrobus, Mr Coutts Trotter, Mr Edward Marjoribanks, and Mr
Edmund Antrobus, and he appointed them executors, together with William
Adam the younger, of Lincoln's Inn, Andrew Dickie, of the Strand, and
Thomas Atkinson and John Parkinson, both of Lincoln's Inn Fields."
Harriot, Duchess of St Albans, widow of Thomas Coutts, made her will
on March 14, 1837, six months before her decease, her executors being
Sir Coutts Trotter, Edward Marjoribanks, Sir Edmund Antrobus, and
William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> Matthew Coulthurst, all of the Strand, with William George
Adam, Accountant-General of the High Court of Chancery, and John
Parkinson, of Lincoln's Inn Fields. She bequeathed to her husband the
use and enjoyment during his life of Holly Lodge, Highgate (which Mr
Coutts had bought for her at a cost of 25,000), the use and enjoyment
of rooms in the Strand, a legacy of 10,000 for furniture, a selection
of plate, not exceeding in value 2000, and an annuity of 10,000; but
the annuity and the use and enjoyment of Holly Lodge were to cease if
he should permit his uncle, Lord Amilius Beauclerk, or his brothers,
Frederick or Charles Beauclerk, to reside in these quarters for one
week or more in any one year. She left her jewellery to Angela Georgina
Burdett&mdash;subsequently the Baroness Burdett-Coutts&mdash;and she also gave,
devised, and bequeathed all her real and personal estate, including her
shares and interest of and in the banking-house and business in the
Strand, in trust to pay the income thereof to the said Angela Georgina
Burdett until she should marry or die, which should first happen,
and after such marriage to pay the same to her for her own sole and
separate use and benefit during the then residue of her life.</p>

<p>At the southern end of Robert Street, through which Thomas Coutts
looked at the Surrey hills, there was, in modern times, the Caledonian
Hotel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> which, with its hideous plaster front, was a blot upon the
surrounding architecture. This, in the late seventies of the last
century, was the meeting-place of the Savage Club. The "Savages" then
migrated to Lancaster House, Savoy, but in 1889 they returned to the
Adelphi, having taken the lease of their present premises, Nos. 6
and 7 Adelphi Terrace. Excepting that the beautiful ceiling of their
principal room is covered with whitewash, the rooms still contain much
of the Adams imprint. Next door, however, Garrick's house is little
changed; the ceiling in his drawing-room was painted by Antonio Zucchi,
A.R.A., Angelica Kauffmann's second husband, and it is in a splendid
state of preservation, as is the magnificent marble chimney-piece,
which is said to have cost 300&mdash;the rooms in which Mr and Mrs Garrick
died are now in the occupation of the Institution of Naval Architects.
King Edward VII. was an honorary life member of the Savage Club
from 1882 until his Accession in 1901. Honorary life members of the
present year of grace include the Prince of Wales, Earl Roberts, Lord
Kitchener, Mr Whitelaw Reid, and Mr Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain).
The treasurer and secretary&mdash;both of which posts are honorary&mdash;are Sir
James D. Linton, R.I., and Mr Edwin E. Peacock respectively. The club
is limited to five hundred town and one hundred country members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most notable residents of the Adelphi in modern times
was Mr Thomas Hardy, who, happily still with us, lived at No. 8
Adelphi Terrace in the years 1863-67. During that time, "I sat there
drawing," he wrote to a friend, who has kindly given me the privilege
of reproducing his words, "inside the eastern-most window of the
front room on the first floor above the ground floor, occasionally
varying the experience by idling on the balcony. I saw from there the
Embankment and Charing Cross Bridge built, and, of course, used to
think of Garrick and Johnson." Mr Hardy, who was born in 1840, was
then practising architecture under Sir A. Blomfield, A.R.A. The room
in which the future author of <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> and <i>Tess
of the D'Urbervilles</i> worked "contained at that date a fine Adams
mantel-piece in white marble, on which we used to sketch caricatures in
pencil."</p>

<p>The coming of the Savage Club to Adelphi Terrace occasioned much sorrow
to one of the kindest-hearted men who ever lived&mdash;E.L. Blanchard, who
had rooms in No. 6 from April 1876 until March 1889, a few months
before his death. Edward Litt Laman Blanchard&mdash;son of William Blanchard
(1769-1835), an actor who was celebrated for his Bob Acres, Sir Hugh
Evans, Fluellen, Menenius, and Polonius&mdash;was born on December 11, 1820.
He was a prolific writer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> and for many years was the dramatic critic
and theatrical chronicler of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. He wrote the Drury
Lane pantomime for thirty-seven years&mdash;a marvellous record. On December
11, 1888, he writes in his <i>Diary</i>: "Am reminded, to my amazement, that
I am sixty-eight this day. Thank God for the many unexpected blessings
I have had." On the following day he hears "with inexpressible regret
that the Savage Club signed yesterday an agreement to take these
premises, and the adjoining house, No. 7." On the 15th he writes:
"Receive formal notice to give up possession of Adelphi Terrace on Lady
Day next, which troubles me greatly." His death occurred on September
4, 1889. Among the many shadows of the past which rise up before me
as I bring to a close this history of the Adelphi of the Brothers
Adam, there is none for which I have a greater reverence, or greater
affection, than that of gentle, sweet-natured E.L. Blanchard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the Adelphi proper, but still within its precincts,
we come to the history of York House, the site of which is indicated
by Villiers Street, Buckingham Street, and York Buildings, Adelphi.
"Next beyond this Durham House," wrote John Stow, in 1598, "is another
great house, sometime belonging to the Bishop of Norwich, and was
his London lodging, which now pertaineth to the Archbishop of York
by this occasion. In the year 1529, when Cardinal Wolsey, Archbishop
of York, was indicted in the Premunire, whereby King Henry VIII.
was entitled to his goods and possessions, he also seized into his
hands the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> archbishop's house, commonly called York Place, and
changed the name thereof into Whitehall; whereby the archbishops of
York, being dispossessed, and having no house of repair about London,
Queen Mary gave unto Nicholas Heath, then Archbishop of York, and to
his successors, Suffolk House in Southwark, lately built by Charles
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, as I have showed. This house the said
archbishop sold, and bought the aforesaid house of old time belonging
to the bishops of Norwich, which of this last purchase is now called
York House. The lord chancellors or lord keepers of the Great Seal of
England have been lately there lodged." Our other great chronicler,
Strype, records that Archbishop Heath, on August 6, 1557, "obtained
a license for the alienation of this capital messuage of Suffolk
Place; and to apply the price thereof for the buying of other houses
called also Suffolk Place, lying near Charing Cross; as appears from a
register belonging to the Dean and Chapter of York." Archbishop Heath
did not occupy York House for long, and his successors appear to have
let it to the Lord Keepers of the Great Seal.</p>

<p>Lord Chancellor Bacon, the son of Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper, was
born here in 1561, and here his father died in 1579. One of the most
interesting of literary associations is that of Francis Bacon with York
House. He built an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> aviary here at a cost of 300, and here Aubrey laid
the scene of his jesting with the fishermen, although Bacon himself
placed it at Chelsea: "His Lordship (Bacon) being in Yorke House garden
looking on Fishers, as they were throwing their nett, asked them
what they would take for their draught; they answered so much: his
Lo<sup>p</sup> would offer them no more but so much. They drew up their nett,
and it were only 2 or 3 little fishes; his Lo<sup>p</sup> then told them, it
had been better for them to have taken his offer. They replied, they
hoped to have had a better draught; but said his Lo<sup>p</sup>, 'Hope is a good
breakfast, but an ill supper.'"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> When the Duke of Lennox wished to
buy, or exchange, York House,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Bacon replied: "For this you will
pardon me: York House is the house where my father died, and where I
first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> breathed, and there will I yield my last breath, if so please
God and the King." In 1621, however, Bacon, charged before the House
of Commons with bribery, confessed that he was guilty of "corruption
and neglect," and, on May 21 of that year, the Great Seal was "fetched
from" the keeping of Lord Bacon of York House. A little later, Bacon
had "leave to repair to York House for a fortnight, but remained so
long that he had warning to repair to Gorhambury." Another keeper of
the Great Seal was Sir John Puckering, who died at York House in 1596.
Lord Chancellor Egerton also died here, in 1617. The commission of
enquiry into the death, in 1613, of Sir Thomas Overbury, was held at
York House, and resulted in the hanging of four of the agents of Lady
Essex. The Orders of October 17, 1615, to Somerset "to keep his chamber
near the Cockpit," and to his countess "to keep her chamber at the
Blackfriars, or at Lord Knollys's house near the Tilt yard," are dated
from York House. An attempt made, in 1588, to obtain the property from
Queen Elizabeth, has been attributed to the Earl of Essex, to whom the
custody of the house was subsequently committed. Edwin Sandys, when
Archbishop of York, wrote a "secret letter" to Lord Burghley entreating
his lordship to use his influence with the Queen for the refusal of
the request of the Earl of Essex, who, curiously enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> was under
surveillance at York House during the time&mdash;October 6, 1599, to March
20, 1600&mdash;that he was in the charge of Lord Keeper Egerton.</p>

<p>In some manner, which is not very clear, York House passed to George,
the first Duke of Buckingham of the Villiers family. He "borrowed" it
from Archbishop Mathew till such time as he could persuade him "to
accept as good a seat as that was in lieu of the same, which could
not be so soon compassed, as the Duke of Buckingham had occasion
to make use of rooms for the entertainment of foreign princes." On
"Whitson-Eve," 1624, as recorded in Archbishop Laud's <i>Diary</i>, "the
Bill passed in Parliament for the King to have York House in exchange
for other lands. This was for the Lord Duke of Buckingham." The old
structure was destroyed, and a large, but temporary, building, erected
in its place, great mirrors covering many of the walls. Nothing remains
of this house; but the water-gate, at the foot of Buckingham Street,
still marks the stately approach to the York House of Buckingham's
time. "I am confident there are some that live," wrote Sir Balthazar
Gerbier, who was the keeper of York House and collector of pictures for
Buckingham, "who will not deny that they have heard the King of blessed
memory, graciously pleased to avouch he had seen in Anno 1628, close
to the Gate of York House, in a roome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> not above 35 feet square, as
much as could be represented as Sceans, in the great Banqueting Room of
Whitehall." The "sceans" were the pictures with which York House was
filled by Buckingham, who paid Rubens a hundred thousand florins for an
art collection "'more like that of a prince than a private gentleman'
with which the great painter of Antwerp had enriched his own dwelling.
Among the pictures were no fewer than 19 by Titian; 21 by Bassano; 13
by Paul Veronese; 17 by Tintoretto; 3 by Raphael; 3 by Leonardo da
Vinci; and 13 by Rubens himself."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Buckingham did not live at York
House: he only used it on state occasions. He was assassinated, at
Portsmouth, by John Felton, on August 23, 1628.</p>

<p>The entertainments given by Buckingham at York House were unrivalled in
their magnificence. A contemporary account of one of them is furnished
by the great courtier, Franois de Bassompiere (1579-1646), Marshal
of France, in his <i>Embassy to England</i>,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> an account of his sojourn
here in 1626. "The King," he says, "supped at one table with the Queen
and me, which was served by a complete ballet at each course with
sundry representations&mdash;changes of scenery, tables, and music: the
Duke waited on the King at table, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> Earl of Carlisle on the Queen,
and the Earl of Holland on me. After supper the King and we were led
into another room, where the assembly was, and one entered it by a
kind of turnstile, as in convents, without any confusion, where there
was a magnificent ballet, in which the Duke danced, and afterwards we
set to, and danced country dances till four in the morning; thence we
were shown into vaulted apartments, where there were five different
collations." D'Israeli extracted an account of the same entertainment
from the Sloane MSS.: "Last Sunday at night, the Duke's grace
entertained their Majesties and the French Ambassador at York House
with great feasting and show, where all things came down in clouds;
amongst which, one rare device was a representation of the French King
and the two Queens, with their chiefest attendants, and so to the life
that the Queen's Majesty could name them. It was four o'clock in the
morning before they parted, and then the King and Queen, together with
the French Ambassador, lodged there. Some estimate this entertainment
at five or six thousand pounds."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Sir Balthazar Gerbier, writing
to Buckingham on February 8, 1625, says: "Sometimes, when I am
contemplating the treasure of rarities which your Excellency has in so
short a time amassed, I cannot but feel astonishment in the midst of
my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> joy. For out of all the amateurs, and princes, and kings, there
is not one who has collected in forty years as many pictures as your
Excellency has collected in five. Let enemies and people ignorant of
paintings say what they will, they cannot deny that pictures are noble
ornaments, a delightful amusement, and histories that one may read
without fatigue. Our pictures, if they were to be sold a century after
our death, would sell for good cash, and for three times more than they
have cost. I wish I could only live a century, if they were sold, to be
able to laugh at those facetious folk, who say it is money cast away
for baubles and shadows: I know <i>they</i> will be pictures still, when
those ignorants will be less than shadows."</p>

<p class="caption">THE BALL-ROOM, NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE.</p>

<p>Buckingham, as is well known, was the "Steenie" of King James, who
quoted the passage (Acts vi. 15), in which it is said of St Stephen:
"All that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face
as it had been the face of an angel." So the King called his favourite
Stephen, and the appellation became corrupted into Steenie. Buckingham,
undoubtedly, was a man of great personal attraction. Godfrey Goodman,
Bishop of Gloucester, who knew him well, says that, "Of all others
he was most active; he had a very lovely complexion; he was the
handsomest bodied man of England; his limbs so well compacted, and his
conversation so pleasing, and of so sweet a disposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>tion. And truly
his intellectuals were very great; he had a sound judgment, and was
of a quick apprehension, insomuch that I have heard it from two men,
and very great men (neither of them had gotten so little as 3600 per
annum by the Court), whom of all men in the world Buckingham had most
wronged&mdash;yet I heard both those men say and give him this testimony,
that he was as inwardly beautiful as he was outwardly, and that the
world had not a more ingenious gentleman, or words to that effect."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>His son, George, the second Duke of Buckingham, was born in Wallingford
House, which stood on the site of the Admiralty buildings, Whitehall,
the house having been purchased by his father from Lord Wallingford,
in 1621-22. At Wallingford House, "and at York House in the Strand,"
says Leigh Hunt, "he turned night into day, and pursued his intrigues,
his concerts, his dabblings in chemistry and the philosopher's stone,
and his designs on the crown; for Charles's character, and the
devices of Buckingham's fellow quacks and astrologers, persuaded him
that he had a chance of being king. When a youth, he compounded with
Cromwell, and married Fairfax's daughter;&mdash;he was afterwards all for
the king, when he was not 'all for rhyming' or ousting him;&mdash;when
an old man, or near it (for these prodigious possessors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> of animal
spirits have a trick of lasting a long while), he was still a youth in
improvidence and dissipation, and his whole life was a dream of uneasy
pleasure".<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Apart from his Court intrigues and his disordered life,
he is interesting to lovers of literature and the stage by reason of
his various satires and verses, and, particularly, for <i>The Rehearsal</i>,
brought out in 1671, in which he ridiculed contemporary dramatists,
including Dryden. But Dryden had his revenge, for, ten years later, he
made Buckingham the Zimri of his <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Buckingham, whose estates had been confiscated by Cromwell in 1648,
regained control of York House in a curious manner&mdash;by marriage with
the daughter of General Fairfax. Cromwell had bestowed this property
on Fairfax at the time of the Civil Wars. "Every chamber," says Brian
Fairfax in his <i>Memoirs</i> of Buckingham, "was adorned with the arms
of Villiers and Manners, lions and peacocks. He (Lord Fairfax) was
descended from the same ancestors, Earls of Rutland." We have the same
authority for the statement that the "superstitious pictures in York
House" were ordered to be sold on August 20, 1645, but not before one
John Trayleman, an "old trusty servant," had smuggled some of the
treasures over to Holland, where they found a purchaser in the Archduke
Leopold. For one of these pictures, the Ecce Homo, by Titian, the first
Duke of Buckingham had been offered 7000, either in money or land,
by Lord Arundel. In this painting, likenesses of the Pope, Charles
V., and Solyman the Magnificent were introduced. The Duke returned to
England in 1657, and obtained an introduction to General Fairfax, who
gave a willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> ear to the marriage proposition. The lady, we are told,
could not resist the fascination of "the most graceful and beautiful
person that any court in Europe saw," and the marriage took place
at Nun Appleton, near York&mdash;a seat of Lord Fairfax&mdash;on September 7,
1657. According to Jesse, Cromwell, "who was supposed to have intended
Buckingham for one of his own daughters, was greatly enraged when he
heard of the match, and immediately committed Buckingham to the Tower.
Fairfax demanded his release, which, being angrily and obstinately
refused by the Protector, a quarrel was the consequence." After the
death of Cromwell, Buckingham was permitted to remove to Windsor
Castle. At the Restoration he was restored to his property, and became
"the most reckless, unprincipled, and irregular character" at the Court
of Charles II.</p>

<p>York House fell from its high estate on coming into the possession
of General Fairfax. On November 27, 1655, Evelyn "went to see York
House and gardens, belonging to the former greate Buckingham, but now
much ruin'd thro' neglect." In 1661, Baron de Batteville, the Spanish
Ambassador, was lodged there, a fact which affords us, through the
pages of Samuel Pepys, a curious peep into the past. On May 19, 1661
(Lord's Day), this delightful chronicler walked in the morning towards
Westminster, and, seeing many people at York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> House, he went down from
the Strand "and found them at masse, it being the Spanish Ambassador's;
and so I got into one of the galleries, and there heard two masses
done, I think not in so much state as I have seen them heretofore.
After that, into the garden, and walked an hour or two, but found it
not so fine a place as I took it for by the outside." In September
of the same year, Pepys witnessed a strange encounter between the
retainers of the ambassadors of Spain and France, which terminated
at York House: "This morning, up by moonshine, at five o'clock, to
Whitehall, to meet Mr More at the Privy Seale, and ther I heard of a
fray between the two embassadors of Spaine and France, and that this
day being the day of the entrance of an embassador from Sweeden, they
intended to fight for the precedence. Our king, I heard, ordered that
no Englishman should meddle in the business, but let them do what they
would. And to that end, all the soldiers in town were in arms all
the day long, and some of the train bands in the city, and a great
bustle through the city all the day. Then we took coach (which was the
business I came for) to Chelsey, to my Lord Privy Seale, and there got
him to seal the business. Here I saw by daylight two very fine pictures
in the gallery, that a little while ago I saw by night; and did also
go all over the house, and found it to be the prettiest contrived
house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> that I ever saw in my life. So back again; and Whitehall light,
and saw the soldiers and people running up and down the streets. So I
went to the Spanish embassadors and the French, and there saw great
preparations on both sides; but the French made the most noise and
ranted most, but the other made no stir almost at all; so that I was
afraid the other would have too great a conquest over them. Then to
the wardrobe and dined there; and then abroad, and in Cheapside hear,
that the Spanish hath got the best of it, and killed three of the
French coachhorses and several men, and is gone through the city next
to our King's coach: at which it is strange to see how all the city
did rejoice. And, indeed, we do naturally all love the Spanish and
hate the French. But I, as I am in all things curious, presently got
to the water-side, and there took oars to Westminster Palace, and ran
after them through all the dirt, and the streets full of people; till
at last, in the Mews [Charing Cross], I saw the Spanish coach go with
fifty drawn swords at least to guard it, and our soldiers shouting
for joy. And so I followed the coach, and then met it at Yorke House,
where the embassador lies; and there it went in with great state. So
then I went to the French house, where I observe still, that there is
no men in the world of a more insolent spirit where they do well, nor
before they begin a matter, and more abject if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> they do miscarry, than
these people are; for they all look like dead men, and not a word among
them, but shake their heads. The truth is, the Spaniards were not only
observed to fight more desperately, but also they did outwitt them;
first in lining their own harnesse with chains of iron that they could
not be cut, then in setting their coach in the most advantageous place,
and to appoint men to guard every one of their horses, and others for
to guard the coach, and others the coachman. And, above all, in setting
upon the French horses and killing them, for by that means the French
were not able to stir. There were several men slaine of the French, and
one or two of the Spaniards, and one Englishman by a bullet. Which is
very observable, the French were at least four to one in number, and
had near one hundred cases of pistols among them, and the Spaniards had
not one gun among them, which is for their honour for ever, and the
others' disgrace. So having been very much daubed with dirt, I got a
coach and home; where I vexed my wife in telling her of this story, and
pleading for the Spaniards against the French."</p>

<p>But the whirligig of time brings in its own revenges, and, in 1672, the
French Ambassador was installed at York House. On April 4, Evelyn "went
to see the fopperies of the Papists at Somerset House and York House,
where now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> French Ambassador had caus'd to be represented our
Blessed Saviour at the Paschal Supper with his disciples, in figures
and puppets made as big as the life, of wax-work, curiously clad and
sitting round a large table, the roome nobly hung, and shining with
innumerable lamps and candles; this was expos'd to all the world, all
the Citty came to see it: such liberty had the Roman Catholicks at this
time obtain'd." In 1663, the Russian Ambassador was in occupation.
On June 6, of that year, Pepys journeyed "To York House, where the
Russian Embassador do lie; and there I saw his people go up and down
losing themselves: they are all in a great hurry, being to be gone
the beginning of next week. But that that pleased me best, was the
remains of the noble soul of the late Duke of Buckingham appearing in
his house, in every place, in the door-cases and the windows. Sir John
Hebden, the Russian Resident, did tell me how he is vexed to see things
at Court ordered as they are by nobody that attends to business, but
every man himself or his pleasures. He cries up my Lord Ashley to be
almost the only man that he sees to look after business; and with the
ease and mastery, that he wonders at him. He cries out against the
King's dealing so much with goldsmiths, and suffering himself to have
his purse kept and commanded by them."</p>

<p>How the French Ambassador came to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> residence at York House in
April, 1672&mdash;as most certainly he was&mdash;is somewhat curious. For, by
a deed dated January 1, of that year, the Duke sold the house and
gardens in order to obtain money for his extravagances. The purchasers
were Roger Higgs, of St Margaret's, Westminster, Esq.; Emery Hill, of
Westminster, gentleman; Nicholas Eddyn, of Westminster, woodmonger;
and John Green, of Westminster, brewer; and the price of the property
was 30,000. In 1668, the rental of "York House and tenements, in the
Strand," had been fixed at 1359, 10s. The Duke made it a condition of
the sale that his name should be commemorated in the new buildings to
be erected on the site of York House; hence we have York Buildings,
Buckingham Street, Villiers Street, and Duke Street, at the present
day. There was even an "Of" Lane, but this has been converted into
George Court. It is said that, with part of the money thus obtained,
the Duke purchased land in Dowgate. Be this as it may, the nomenclature
of the York House estate caused much derision at the time, and brought
forth <i>The Litany of the Duke of Buckingham</i>, a merry satire containing
the following exhortation:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"From damning whatever we don't understand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">From purchasing at Dowgate, and selling in the Strand,</span><br />

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> every trace of York House itself has been long ago
obliterated, there still remains the water-gate, one of the most
interesting historical relics in London. Peter the Great's house,
which formerly overlooked it, has given place only this year to a new
building, but the "stairs" which were erected for the first Duke of
Buckingham are still here to remind us of many celebrities who came to
this hallowed spot from the days of "Steenie" until the beginning of
the last century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> The architect of this charming piece of work was
Inigo Jones (1573-1652), and the date of its erection can safely be
attributed to the year 1625. One Nicholas Stone (1586-1647) has been
wrongly credited with the design. In his <i>Account Book of Workes</i>,
which is in the library of Sir John Soane's Museum, it is said: "The
Water-gate at York House hee dessined and built; and ye right hand
lion hee did, fronting y<sup>e</sup> Thames. Mr Kearne, a Jarman, his brother
by marrying, did y<sup>e</sup> Shee lion." But Stone&mdash;whose best work was in
tombs, those of Bodley at Oxford and Donne in St Paul's being his
most celebrated&mdash;carried out many of the designs of Inigo Jones, and,
from this cause, I fancy, came his claim to the York water-gate.
These "stairs," as they were commonly called, have been described as
"unquestionably the most perfect piece of building that does honour
to the name of Inigo Jones&mdash;planned in so exquisite a taste, formed
of such equal and harmonious parts, and adorned with such proper and
elegant decorations, that nothing can be censured or added. It is at
once happy in its situation, beyond comparison, and fancied in a style
exactly suited to that situation. The <i>rock-work</i>, or rustic, can never
be better introduced than in buildings by the side of water; and,
indeed, it is a great question whether it ought to be made use of any
where else." The arms of the Villiers family&mdash;now the worse for wear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
but still visible&mdash;appear on the side facing the Thames, and, on the
reverse, is to be seen their motto: <i>Fidei Coticula Crux</i>&mdash;the Cross
is the Touch-stone of Faith. The terrace on this side was planted with
lime-trees, and, less than a century ago, was "supported by a rate
raised upon the houses in the neighbouring streets; and, being enclosed
from the public, forms an agreeable promenade for the inhabitants."</p>

<p>This famous water-gate has had its vicissitudes. In 1767, there was
a proposal for its removal, but, fortunately, this act of vandalism
was not allowed to take place. The suggestion gave rise to various
protests, one of which took the following form:&mdash;</p>

<p>The gate had become so neglected in 1823 that it was necessary to
repair the roof and stone-work and to renew the iron-work. This was
done at a cost of 300, defrayed by a rate levied on the occupants of
York Buildings. Thirteen years later, however, I find a complaint that
the gate had been allowed "from neglect, to be almost smothered in
river mud." Again, in 1854, it was said to be "in a ruinous state"&mdash;a
view of the case which is somewhat exaggerated, for the gate is still
in wonderful preservation, considering its age and the destructive
nature of the London climate. The gate, and the terrace behind, are now
under the control of the London County Council. It is a pity that the
"stairs" are so hidden in the hollow of the gardens, but this cannot
be avoided. The terrace, which leads from Villiers Street to York
Buildings, with an entrance from Buckingham Street, is well-kept, and,
very properly, it is only open during the day.</p>

<p>In the frontispiece to this volume, and in some of the other
illustrations, there is to be seen, to the left of the water-gate, a
strange-looking "octangular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> structure, about seventy feet high, with
small round loopholes as windows." This is the tower of some works
which were made in the twenty-seventh year of King Charles II. for the
supply of water from the silvery Thames to the inhabitants of the west
end. Many of the wooden pipes through which the water was conveyed have
been excavated from time to time in Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, and
other places. In 1688, there were forty-eight shares in the company.
After the Scotch rebellion in 1715, the company invested large sums
in purchasing forfeited estates, which no Scot would buy. Bankruptcy
followed, and, in 1783, the Scotch estates were sold for 102,537.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
A curious description of the works is given in the <i>Foreigner's
Guide to London</i> for 1720: "Here you see a high wooden tower and a
water-engine of a new invention, that draws out of the Thames above
three tons of water in one minute, by means of the steam arising from
water boiling in a great copper, a continual fire being kept to that
purpose; the steam being compressed and condensed, moves, by its
evaporation, and strikes a counterpoise, which counterpoise striking
another, at last moves a great beam, which, by its motion of going
up and down, draws water from the river which mounts through great
iron pipes to the height of the tower, discharging itself there into
a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> leaden cistern; and thence falling through other large iron
pipes, fills them that are laid along the streets, and so continuing to
run through wooden pipes as far as Mar-bone fields, falls there into
a large pond or reservoir, from whence the new buildings near Hanover
Square, and many thousand houses, are supplied with water. This machine
is certainly a great curiosity, and though it be not so large as that
of Marly in France, yet, considering its smallness in comparison
with that, and the little charge it was built and kept with, and the
quantity of water it draws, its use and benefit is much beyond that."
This steam-engine was not in use after 1731, but it was shown for some
years later as a curiosity. The cost of working the machine, "and some
other reasons concurring, made its proprietors, the York Buildings
Waterworks Company, lay aside the design; and no doubt but the
inhabitants of this neighbourhood are very glad of it, for its working,
which was by sea-coal, was attended with so much smoke, that it not
only must pollute the air thereabouts, but spoil the furniture."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p class="caption">THE DRAWING-ROOM, NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE.</p>

<p>Buckingham Street is hallowed by the memory of many celebrities.
Here, at the last house on the west facing the river (since rebuilt,
and now numbered 14), Samuel Pepys lived from 1684 to 1700. Pepys,
unfortunately, had finished his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> <i>Diary</i> in 1669, or we should have had
some quaint observations from him in reference to his residence here.
The house had been occupied previously by his great friend, William
Hewer, at whose residence in Clapham the genial gossip died in 1703.
No. 14 was the home of William Etty, R.A., from the summer of 1824
until shortly before his death in 1849. He first occupied the ground
floor, but he moved to the top rooms, as he loved to watch the sunsets
over the Thames. The ebb and flow of the river, he declared, was like
life, and "the view from Lambeth to the Abbey not unlike Venice. Here
he invited Thomas Stothard, the famous painter, to breakfast at nine
o'clock, when there is a good light to see my Venetian studies of
colour, which are all hung round the room where I breakfast." In these
rooms, "the artists of two generations have assembled&mdash;Fuseli, Flaxman,
Holland, Constable, and Hilton&mdash;then Turner, Maclise, Dyce, Herbert,
and all the younger race."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Clarkson Stanfield, the landscape
painter, who designed some beautiful scenery for Drury Lane and painted
a drop-scene for Dickens, occupied the lower rooms for some years.</p>

<p>"Should my reader's boat ever stop at York Water Gate," wrote J.T.
Smith, in his <i>Book for a Rainy Day</i>, "let me request him to look
up at the three upper balconied windows of that mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> building
at the south-west corner of Buckingham Street. Those, and the two
adjoining Westminster, give light to chambers occupied by that truly
epic historical painter, and most excellent man, Etty, the Royal
Academician, who has fitted up the balconied room with engravings after
pictures of the three great masters, Raphael, Nicholas Poussin, and
Rubens. The other two windows illuminate his painting room, in which
his mind and colours resplendently shine, even in the face of one of
the grandest scenes in Nature, our River Thames and City edifices, with
a most luxuriant and extensive face of a distant country, the beauties
of which he most liberally delights in showing to his friends from
the leads of his apartments.... The rooms immediately below Mr Etty's
are occupied by Mr Lloyd, a gentleman whose general knowledge in the
graphic art I and many more look up to with the profoundest respect.
The chambers beneath Mr Lloyd's are inhabited by Mr Stanfield, the
landscape painter."</p>

<p>In the house on the opposite corner&mdash;now demolished, as already
stated, but to be seen in the "view of Westminster from the Thames,
1750"&mdash;lived, for three months, in 1698, Peter the Great. Here he
returned from his work at Deptford, spending his evenings with his
cicerone, Lord Carmarthen, drinking a pint of hot brandy, further
warmed by the addition of cayenne pepper, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> he had consumed
numberless draughts of wine. It is said that on one occasion he drank
a pint of brandy, a bottle of sherry, and eight flasks of sack, after
which he went to the theatre. While in Buckingham Street he "was so
annoyed with the vulgar curiosity of intrusive citizens, that he would
sometimes rise from his dinner and leave the room in a rage. Here the
Quakers forced themselves upon him, and presented him with <i>Barclay's
Apology</i>, after which the Czar attended their meeting in Gracechurch
Street. He once asked them of what use they were to any kingdom, since
they would not bear arms. On taking his farewell of King William, Peter
drew a rough ruby, valued at 10,000, from his waistcoat pocket, and
presented it to him screwed up in brown paper. He went back just in
time to crush the Strelitzes, imprison his sister Sophia, and wage war
on Charles XII. The great reformer was only twenty-six years old when
he visited England."</p>

<p>Other famous inhabitants of Buckingham Street include, in 1681, Charles
Sackville, the sixth Earl of Dorset, the poet and wit; in 1706, Robert
Harley (afterwards Earl of Oxford), who received such high praise from
Pope and Swift; and, in 1727, James Wellwood, physician and author. A
very interesting literary association is that of David Hume and Jean
Jacques Rousseau, who, in 1766, were made welcome at his house in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
street by Hume's friend, John Stewart. Subsequently they "removed into
lodgings a few doors off. In one or other of these houses Rousseau laid
the scene of all the imaginary insults heaped upon him by his brother
philosopher, the crowning injury being inflicted at their parting in
Buckingham Street, which Rousseau describes with such comic vehemence.
Whilst here, Rousseau was the object of much curiosity."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Mr
Wheatley also states that No. 22 was the house of Power, the publisher
of the <i>Irish Melodies</i>, to whom Moore wrote so frequently, and that
"Strata" Smith, "the father of modern geology," lived in this street,
his young nephew, John Phillips (afterwards the Oxford professor),
being with him. One of the most noted representatives of Hamlet and
Falstaff died at his house in Buckingham Street in 1785. This was John
Henderson, who, although without many personal advantages, achieved a
great position. He was "the soul of feeling and intelligence."</p>

<p>In the lodge of the terrace at the foot of Buckingham Street lived,
for several years before his death in 1809, Hugh Hewson, the original
of Smollett's Hugh Strap in <i>Roderick Random</i>, the simple, generous
adherent whose generosity and fidelity met with such a base return from
the heartless libertine. Another memory of this small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> street brings
us once more to Dickens and <i>David Copperfield</i>. For it was here that
Copperfield lodged when he was undergoing his month's probation with
Spenlow and Jorkins. Betsy Trotwood announced to her nephew: "'There's
a furnished little set of chambers to be let in the Adelphi, Trot,
which ought to suit you to a marvel.'</p>

<p>"With this brief introduction, she produced from her pocket an
advertisement, carefully cut out of a newspaper, setting forth that in
Buckingham Street in the Adelphi there was to be let furnished, with a
view of the river, a singularly desirable and compact set of chambers,
forming a genteel residence for a young gentleman, a member of one
of the Inns of Court, or otherwise, with immediate possession. Terms
moderate, and could be taken for a month only, if required.</p>

<p>"'Why, this is the very thing, aunt!' said I, flushed with the possible
dignity of living in chambers.</p>

<p>"'Then come,' replied my aunt, immediately resuming the bonnet she had
a minute before laid aside. 'We'll go and look at 'em.'</p>

<p>"Away we went. The advertisement directed us to apply to Mrs Crupp
on the premises, and we rang the area bell, which we supposed to
communicate with Mrs Crupp. It was not until we had rung three or four
times that we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> prevail on Mrs Crupp to communicate with us, but
at last she appeared, being a stout lady with a flounce of flannel
petticoat below a nankeen gown."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> For a further description of
Copperfield's life in Buckingham Street, I must refer my readers to the
pages of Dickens.</p>

<p>The earliest mention that we have of Villiers Street is found in the
diary of the pious and amiable John Evelyn, who, on November 17, 1683,
sets down: "I took a house in Villiers Street, York Buildings, for
the winter, having many important concerns to dispatch, and for the
education of my daughters." Addison's friend, Sir Richard Steele, lived
here after the death of his wife, the jealous "Prue," in 1721, until
1724. While he was here, his last comedy, <i>The Conscious Lovers</i>,
was produced at Drury Lane, in 1722. There was a celebrated music
room in this street. The building, erected in 1680, was popular for
half a century, and was pulled down in 1758. It contained a beautiful
ceiling, painted by Verrio, which had been incorporated from York
House, and, as it could not be removed, it was, perforce, destroyed.
<i>The Fair Penitent</i>, <i>Jane Shore</i>, <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>, and other
well-known pieces were performed here. In the <i>Miscellanies</i> of the
dramatist, Aaron Hill (1685-1750), is "A Prologue for the third night
of <i>Zara</i>"&mdash;which Hill had translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> from Voltaire&mdash;"when first
played at the Great Musick Room, in Villars Street, York Buildings," in
1735. The representative of Lusignan&mdash;one of Garrick's best parts&mdash;a
gentleman named Bond, expired on the stage. At the first representation
of the piece, a young gentleman, a relation of the author's, attempted
the character of Osman, but without success, despite the great pains
taken at rehearsal by the adapter. <i>Zara</i> was still more remarkable for
the appearance in it, at the age of twenty-five, of Mrs Cibber, who
subsequently achieved such great fame on the stage. Zara was her first
attempt in tragedy. On the sole authority of that wicked libeller and
scurrilous writer, "Anthony Pasquin," otherwise John Williams, "one
of the dirtiest and most disreputable fellows that ever disgraced the
literary profession," it has been related that Garrick, three years
before he appeared for the first time on the London stage, had acted
in the Duke's Theatre, and that "the ladies who were present were so
fascinated by Mr Garrick's powers that they offered him their trinkets
and their purses from the boxes." This is not so. Garrick did not play
before the public in London until October 19, 1741.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last of the great mansions of the Strand, Northumberland
House, which was swept away so recently as 1874, was a landmark of
great antiquity. For it terminated the palaces of the nobles which
existed for centuries on the north bank of the Thames from Blackfriars
to Charing Cross. It may be observed that in 1353 the Strand was an
open highway, with here and there a great man's house where gardens
stretched to the water's edge. It was then so impassable that Edward
III. directed the levying of a tax upon wool, leather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> wine, and "all
goods" carried to Westminster from Temple Bar to the Abbey, for the
repair of the road; and he further ordered that all owners of houses
adjacent to the highway should repair as much as lay before their
doors. "There was no continued street here," says Pennant, "till about
1533: before that time it entirely cut off Westminster from London, and
nothing intervened except a few scattered houses, and a village which
afterwards gave name to the whole. St Martin's stood literally in the
fields. But about the year 1560 a street was formed, loosely built;
for all the houses on the south side had great gardens to the river,
were called by their owners' names, and in aftertimes gave name to
the several streets that succeeded them, pointing down to the Thames;
each of them had stairs for the conveniency of taking boat.... The
north side was a mere line of houses from Charing Cross to Temple Bar;
all beyond was country. The gardens which occupied part of the site
of Covent Garden were bounded by fields, and St Giles's was a distant
country village."</p>

<p>The site of Northumberland House was that which had been previously
occupied by the "hospital" or chapel of St Mary Rounceval. "Then," says
Stow, "there was an hospital of St Marie Rouncivall by Charing Cross (a
cell to the priory and convent of Roncesvalles in Navarre, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> Pamplona
diocese), where a fraternity was founded in the 15th year of Edward
IV., but now the same is suppressed and turned into tenements." On the
other hand, Pennant gives it a still greater antiquity, for he states
that the chapel was founded, by William, Earl of Pembroke, in the
reign of Henry III., repressed by Henry V. among the alien priories,
and rebuilt by Edward IV., "who fixed a fraternity in it." Dissolved
by Henry VIII., the property was granted by Edward VI. to Sir Thomas
Cawarden, a private individual who did not attain to fame. From him it
passed to Sir Robert Brett, and thence, by purchase, to Henry Howard,
Earl of Northampton, who, in the reign of James I., built the immediate
predecessor of Northumberland House. This Henry Howard, the first Earl
of Northampton (1540-1614) was the second son of Henry Howard, Earl of
Surrey, the poet. He was the most learned nobleman of his day. He may
have had some religious sentiment in purchasing the original site of
the chapel of St Mary, for he lived and died a Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>In the building of his "sumptuous palace," which he called Northampton
House, he had for his architects Bernard Jansen, who was more a
stonemason than an architect, and another maker of funeral monuments,
Gerrard Christmas (Garret Christmas). The latter carved for himself
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> initials C. . (Christmas dificavit), in large capitals over
the old stone gateway, which was replaced by a new front towards the
Strand in the reign of George II. At that time the house consisted of
three sides of a quadrangle, the centre facing the Strand, and, of
course, with gardens down to the river. The Earl of Northampton died
here in 1614, and by his will bequeathed the house and garden to his
nephew, Thomas Howard, first Earl of Suffolk, the second son of Thomas
Howard the third, fourth Duke of Norfolk. As Lord Thomas Howard he
distinguished himself against the Armada in 1588. He completed the
quadrangle of Northampton House by building the front towards the
Thames, and he changed the name to Suffolk House. The Earl of Suffolk
died here in 1626, and his son, Theophilus, inherited the property.
On his death, in 1640, James, the third Earl of Suffolk (1619-1688),
inherited it. His sister, the Lady Elizabeth Howard, was married, in
1642, to Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland. By an indenture dated
a few days before the marriage, the property was conveyed by the Earl
of Suffolk to the Earl of Northumberland, a change which led also to
the nomenclature of the house, which has had such a long career, and
the destruction of which many Londoners still lament.</p>

<p>Before coming to the history of Northumberland House as it appeared
from the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> seventeenth century&mdash;when great changes were
made in its structure&mdash;until its demolition in 1874, it is interesting
to note that one of the quaintest, and, in some respects, most charming
of the old English poems had its origin in the marriage of Roger Boyle,
Lord Broghill, the first Earl of Orrery, to Lady Margaret Howard,
daughter of the first Earl of Suffolk, the builder of Northampton
House. This is the event which called forth, in 1637, Sir John
Suckling's <i>Ballade upon a Wedding</i>, in which one of the prettiest
conceits in the English language occurs. The verses are too long to
quote <i>in extenso</i>, but some extracts may be given, as they are germane
to the matter of this particular history. The wedding is supposed to be
described by a rustic, writing to his friend in the country:&mdash;</p>

<p>Algernon Percy, the tenth Earl of Northumberland, who was called
by Lord Clarendon "the proudest man alive," became guardian of the
two youngest children of Charles I. in 1645, and was one of the
commissioners appointed to negotiate with the King at Newport in
1648. He took no part in public affairs during the Commonwealth and
Protectorate. In the spring of 1660, George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> Monk&mdash;afterwards the
Duke of Albemarle, and the husband of "Nan" Clarges&mdash;was invited,
with the Earl of Manchester, Sir William Waller, and others to
Northumberland House, and here, "in secret confidence with them," says
Clarendon, "some of those measures were concerted which led to the
speedy restoration of the Monarchy." Algernon Percy, who was a privy
councillor after the Restoration, died in 1668. His son and successor,
Josceline Percy, dying in 1670, without male issue, the property passed
to his daughter, the Lady Elizabeth Percy (1667-1722). This lady had
a strange matrimonial career. At the age of twelve she was "married"
to Henry Cavendish, Earl of Ogle (son and heir of Henry, Duke of
Newcastle), but he died in his youth. Two years later&mdash;that is to say,
in 1681&mdash;she espoused Thomas Thynne, of Longleat, Wilts.</p>

<p>Thynne, who was nicknamed "Tom of Ten Thousand," in consequence of
his great wealth, was the Issachar of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>. Lady
Elizabeth, soon after the death of Lord Ogle, had been given in
marriage by her grandmother to Thynne, who, however, had agreed, on
account of the youth of his bride, that the marriage should not be
consummated until a year had elapsed. The lady, however, took such a
dislike to Thynne that she fled for protection to Lady Temple at the
Hague. "In the meantime, the famous Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> Knigsmark&mdash;noted for his
beauty and intrigues in most of the Courts of Europe&mdash;had accidentally
met Lady Ogle in public, and had either fallen in love with her
person, or with the vast fortune of which she was the mistress. That
the feeling was reciprocal there is not the least reason to suppose.
Knigsmark, however, equally daring and unprincipled, determined by
foul, if not by fair means, to make her his wife, and, as the first
step, projected the assassination of the unfortunate Thynne. The
persons whom he hired to commit the crime were three foreigners&mdash;one
Captain Vratz, a German; a Lieutenant Stern, a Swede; and one George
Borotski, a Pole. The two former seem to have been as daring and
reckless adventurers as any age could produce. Borotski, on the other
hand, was a quiet, uneducated man, who appears to have acted entirely
from a feeling of retainership, without any thought of the gold which
had induced his accomplices to undertake to commit the crime. The
night of Sunday, the 12th of February 1682, was fixed upon for the
perpetration of the foul deed. Accordingly, having had their several
parts assigned to them, between seven and eight o'clock the three
assassins, mounted on horseback, posted themselves in a part of Pall
Mall, nearly opposite to the present Opera Colonnade, through which
they had ascertained the equipage of Thynne was likely to pass. As
soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> as the coach appeared in sight, they all three rode up to the
window, and, by their imposing attitude, compelled the coachman to
halt. One shot only was fired, which was from a musketoon, carried by
Borotski. So true, however, was the aim, that as many as five bullets
entered the body of his victim. Thynne was forthwith carried to his
own residence, where he lingered till about six o'clock the following
morning, when he expired."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Knigsmark attempted to escape, but he
was arrested at Gravesend at the very moment that he was about to set
foot on a foreign vessel. He was immediately brought to trial, and,
after some delay, acquitted. His accomplices were condemned to death,
and, on March 10, executed in Pall Mall, on the spot where they had
committed the atrocious crime. Thynne was buried in Westminster Abbey,
and a monument in white marble, representing the tragedy in bas-relief,
was erected to his memory.</p>

<p>Thus, in the language of Lawrence Echard, the historian, Lady Elizabeth
Percy had been a "virgin widow" twice ere, on May 30, 1682&mdash;at the age
of fifteen&mdash;she became a wife. Her third husband was Charles Seymour
(1662-1748), the sixth Duke of Somerset, commonly called "the proud
duke." By an arrangement made before the marriage, he assumed the
surname and arms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> Percy, "but from that stipulation he was released
when her grace attained her majority." The duke and duchess lived "in
great state and magnificence" at Northumberland House. The duchess
died in 1722, and the duke, dying in 1748, was succeeded by his eldest
son, Algernon, Earl of Hertford and seventh Duke of Somerset, who, in
1749, was created Baron Warkworth of Warkworth Castle, Northumberland,
and Earl of Northumberland, with remainder, in default of male issue,
to Sir Hugh Smithson, Bart., a country gentleman of Stanwick, in
Yorkshire, who had married his only daughter, the Lady Elizabeth
Seymour. Sir Hugh Smithson was raised to the dukedom of Northumberland
in 1766, and the title remains with his descendants at the present day.
Algernon Seymour greatly improved the Strand front of Northumberland
House, and built the gallery, or great room, which formed the western
wing of the south side. In the cornice, or balustrading, on the top
of the south front he had inserted the letters and date: A.S.P.N.
(Algernon Seymour Princeps Northumbri), <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1749.</p>

<p>Goldsmith is connected with Northumberland House through his poem,
<i>Edwin and Angelina</i>. It was suggested in the course of discussions
on ballads with Dr Percy (1729-1811), editor of the famous <i>Reliques
of Ancient English Poetry</i>, first published in 1765. Percy, who had
rooms in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> Northumberland House, was visited here by Goldsmith,
and one result of this acquaintanceship was the poem in question,
which was privately "Printed for the amusement of the Countess of
Northumberland." Copies of this edition are extremely rare, and, apart
from their scarcity, they possess an independent value inasmuch as they
show Goldsmith's painstaking care in the preparation of his verse. By
comparing this edition with subsequent issues, "we perceive that even
the gentle opening line has been an after-thought; that four stanzas
have been re-written; and that the two which originally stood last have
been removed altogether. These, for their simple beauty of expression,
it is worth while here to preserve. The action of the poem having
closed without them, they were, on better consideration, rejected; and
young writers should study and make profit of such lessons. Posterity
has always too much upon its hands to attend to what is irrelevant or
needless; and no one so well as Goldsmith seems to have known that the
writer who would hope to live must live by the perfection of his style,
and by the cherished and careful beauty of unsuperfluous writing.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Goldsmith's own account of the blunder which he made on the occasion
of one of his visits to this old mansion is as follows:&mdash;"I dressed
myself in the best manner I could, and, after studying some compliments
I thought necessary on such an occasion, proceeded to Northumberland
House, and acquainted the servants that I had particular business with
the duke. They showed me into an antechamber, where, after waiting some
time, a gentleman, very elegantly dressed, made his appearance. Taking
him for the duke, I delivered all the fine things I had composed,
in order to compliment him on the honour he had done me; when to my
fear and astonishment, he told me I had mistaken him for his master,
who would see me immediately. At that instant the duke came into the
apartment, and I was so confounded on the occasion that I wanted words
barely sufficient to express the sense I entertained of the duke's
politeness, and went away exceedingly chagrined at the blunder I had
committed."</p>

<p>To Sir John Hawkins, the Middlesex magistrate, who drew up Johnson's
will, and, in 1787-89, published Johnson's <i>Life and Works</i>, we are
indebted for a description of another meeting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> the Duke of
Northumberland. "Having one day," he says, "a call to wait on the late
Duke, then Earl of Northumberland, I found Goldsmith waiting for an
audience in an outer room; I asked him what had brought him there: he
told me, an invitation from his lordship. I made my business as short
as I could, and, as a reason, mentioned that Dr Goldsmith was waiting
without. The earl asked me if I was acquainted with him. I told him
I was, adding what I thought likely to recommend him. I retired, and
staid in the outer room to take him home. Upon his coming out, I asked
him the result of his conversation. 'His lordship,' says he, 'told me
he had red (<i>sic</i>) my poem,' meaning the <i>Traveller</i>, and was much
delighted with it; that he was going lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and
that, hearing that I was a native of that country, he should be glad
to do me any kindness.' 'And what did you answer, asked I, to this
gracious offer?' 'Why,' said he, 'I could say nothing but that I had a
brother there, a clergyman, that stood in need of help: as for myself'"
(this was added for the benefit of Hawkins), "'I have no dependence on
the promises of great men: I look to the book-sellers for support; they
are my best friends, and I am not inclined to forsake them for others.'
Thus, adds the teller of the anecdote, did this idiot in the affairs
of the world trifle with his fortunes, and put back the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> hand that was
held out to assist him! Other offers of a like kind he either rejected
or failed to improve, contenting himself with the patronage of one
nobleman, whose mansion afforded him the delights of a splendid table,
and a retreat for a few days from the metropolis."</p>

<p>The incident thus related, says Forster, "may excuse the comment
attached to it. Indeed, the charge of idiotcy in the affairs of the
Hawkins-world may even add to the pleasure with which we contemplate
that older-world picture beside it, of frank simplicity and brotherly
affection. This poor poet, who, incomprehensibly to the Middlesex
magistrate, would thus gently have turned aside to the assistance of
his poorer brother the hand held out to assist himself, had only a few
days before been obliged to borrow fifteen shillings and six-pence 'in
Fleet Street,' of one of those 'best friends' with whose support he is
now fain to be contented." The duke of these anecdotes was Sir Hugh
Smithson (1715-1786), the first Duke of Northumberland of the third
creation. He married, in 1774, Elizabeth Seymour, the heiress of the
Percy property.</p>

<p>The front of Northumberland House was 162 feet in length, the court
being 81 feet square. The coping along the Strand front "was a border
of capital letters," and, at the funeral of Queen Anne of Denmark, in
May 1619, a young man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> the crowd was killed by the letter "S," which
had been pushed off by the too eager spectators on the roof. There
were many famous pictures at Northumberland House. On June 9, 1658,
Evelyn records: "I went to see the Earl of Northumberland's pictures,
whereof that of the Venetian Senators was one of the best of Titian's,
and another of Andrea del Sarto, viz., a Madona, Christ, St John, and
an Old Woman, etc., a St Catherine of Da Vinci, with divers portraits
of Van Dyke; a Nativity of Georgioni; the last of our blessed Kings
(Charles I.) and the Duke of York, by Lely; a roserie by the famous
Jesuits of Bruxelles, and severall more. This was in Suffolk House: the
new front towards the gardens is tollerable, were it not drown'd by
a too massie and clomsie pair of stayres of stone, without any neate
invention."</p>

<p>Fire threatened to destroy the house on more than one occasion. In
March, 1780, an outbreak occurred about five o'clock in the morning,
"and raged till eight, in which time it burnt from the east end, where
it began, to the west. Among the apartments consumed are those of Dr
Percy, Bishop of Carlisle. We are happy to inform our readers that
the greatest part of the doctor's invaluable library is fortunately
preserved." The famous lion which delighted Londoners for a century
and a quarter was placed in his proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> position in 1752. It was cast
in lead, from a model by Carter, and was twelve feet in length. There
is a pleasant fiction to the effect that the noble brute, when first
placed upon his pedestal, had his head towards Carlton House and St
James's Palace, but afterwards upon some rebuff experienced by one
of the dukes of Northumberland turned his face towards the city of
London. The lion was subsequently removed to Syon House, Isleworth,
the Middlesex seat of the Northumberlands. "The vestibule of the
interior was eighty-two feet long, and more than twelve feet in
breadth, ornamented with Doric columns. Each end communicated with a
staircase, leading to the principal apartments facing the garden and
the Thames. They consisted of several spacious rooms fitted up in the
most elegant manner, embellished with paintings, among which might be
found the well-known 'Cornaro Family,' by Titian, a work well worthy
of its reputation, and for which Algernon, Earl of Northumberland,
is stated to have given Vandyck 1000 guineas, and a wonderful vase,
which now has a story of its own; 'St Sebastian Bound,' by Guercino;
'The Adoration of the Shepherds,' by Bassano; and others by well-known
masters. The great feature of the house was the ball-room, or grand
gallery, upwards of 100 feet in length, in which were placed large and
very fine copies by Mengs, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> Raphael's 'School of Athens,' in the
Vatican, of the size of the originals; also the 'Assembly of the Gods,'
and the 'Marriage of Cupid and Psyche,' in the Farnesina; the 'Triumph
of Bacchus and Ariadne,' from Caracci's picture in the Farnese Palace;
and 'Apollo driving the Chariot of the Sun,' from Reni's fresco in the
Villa Rospigliosi, at Rome. These celebrated works, and the decoration
of the noble apartment, constituted it one of the landmarks of high art
in the metropolis. The grand staircase consisted of a centre flight of
thirteen moulded vein marble steps, and two flights of sixteen steps,
with centre landing twenty-two feet by six feet, two circular plinths,
and a handsome and richly-gilt ormolu scroll balustrade, with moulded
Spanish mahogany hand-rail. The mansion contained nearly 150 rooms for
the private use of the family."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The destruction of Northumberland House was due to the necessity of a
direct thoroughfare from Charing Cross to the Embankment. As early as
1866, the Metropolitan Board of Works&mdash;the predecessor of the London
County Council&mdash;had perceived the need, and had suggested a new street
through the site of Northumberland House and its grounds. "The Duke of
Northumberland of that day, however, set his face determinedly against
any interference with his ancestral mansion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> and his opposition
received much support from members of both Houses of Parliament, and
from those who looked with disfavour on a proposal to destroy the last
of the palaces of the English nobles which three centuries ago stood
on the south side of the Strand now occupied by the streets leading
from it to the river. The Metropolitan Board was forced to yield to
the resistance which then and for several years after was offered to
every attempt to get power to take Northumberland House. Eventually
the necessities of the case were so strongly pressed that further
resistance was abandoned, and the Board having, in 1872, learned that
the present Duke of Northumberland was willing to sell his property, an
agreement was in the year 1873 concluded and ratified by Parliament,
under which the Board acquired his Grace's property upon payment of
500,000, the Board at the same time obtaining power to make the new
street."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The opposition of the owner of Northumberland House to
the destruction of this historical property was natural enough, and
many otherwise uninterested persons lamented the proposed demolition.
The Duke of Northumberland&mdash;the sixth duke of his creation&mdash;writing
in 1866, said: "The Duke of Northumberland is naturally desirous that
this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> historical house, commenced by a Howard, continued by a
Percy, and completed by a Seymour, which has been the residence of
his ancestors for two centuries and a half, should continue to be the
residence of his descendants; but the Metropolitan Board of Works
are desirous that this house, which, with its garden, is one of the
landmarks of London, and is probably the oldest residential house in
the metropolis, should be destroyed."</p>

<p>The sale was concluded in June, 1874, and, in September and October
of that year, "the fine old mansion underwent its final stage of
degradation." Its materials were sold by auction. The lots consisted
of 3,000,000 bricks, the grand marble staircase, the elaborate
ornamentation of the various apartments and corridors, and lead to
the weight of 400 tons. The sale realised but 6500, and of this
sum the great staircase&mdash;subsequently removed to No. 49 Prince's
Gate&mdash;brought 360. Some of the pictures had been removed to Alnwick
Castle, Northumberland, others to the ducal town residence, No. 2
Grosvenor Place. "The progress of wealth and luxury," said a writer
in the <i>Standard</i> at the time of the projected demolition, "has long
since dimmed the splendours of what was once the proudest of the
London houses of the English nobility. The march of fashion westward
had left it isolated amidst an uncongenial neighbourhood of small
shops. Commerce had overtaken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> overwhelmed it, so that it stood
somewhat abruptly in the full stream of London life, making it too
violent a contrast with the surrounding houses, and destroying whatever
of felicity there might have been in the situation. In the days when
the Strand was but a road between London and Westminster, lined with
private houses of the great and noble on either side, and with gardens
going down to the river, it might have been an abode fit even for the
proud Earls of Northumberland, to whom it descended. But with the
Thames Embankment on one side, and Trafalgar Square on the other, with
omnibuses perpetually passing its front door, Northumberland House was
a standing anachronism, if not an impediment, which was destined to
succumb to the influence of time and the Metropolitan Board of Works."
It may be added that during the Great Exhibition of 1851, the public
were admitted by ticket to view the house at the rate of ten thousand a
week.</p>

<p>Northumberland Avenue was opened in March, 1876. It is 950 feet long
and 84 feet wide, the width between the pavements being 60 feet.
The Strand portion of the house is marked by the Grand Hotel, the
opening of which, in 1880, was considered of so much importance
that its initiation was attended by the Lord Mayor of the City of
London, who was accompanied by the sheriffs. Two other of the Gordon
hotels in this Avenue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> the Mtropole and Victoria, opened in 1885
and 1887 respectively, indicate the site of the extensive gardens of
Northumberland House. The handsome building of the Constitutional Club,
the offices of the Royal Colonial Institute, and the headquarters
of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, are also in
Northumberland Avenue.</p>

<p>Craven Street, which still retains much of its old-world air, is
chiefly notable for the fact that Benjamin Franklin lived here, at No.
7, at the house of Mrs Margaret Stevenson, during the entire period of
his visits to London as agent for the House of Assembly, Philadelphia,
and "other provinces." Leigh Hunt, speaking of this circumstance, says:
"What a change along the shores of the Thames in a few years (for two
centuries are less than two years in the lapse of time), from the
residence of a set of haughty nobles, who never dreamt that a tradesman
could be anything but a tradesman, to that of a yeoman's son, and a
printer, who was one of the founders of a great state!" He was visited
here in February, 1755, by William Pitt (the first Earl of Chatham,
1708-1788), and, wrote Franklin, "He stayed with me near two hours, his
equipage waiting at the door." The house, which is marked by a tablet,
is now a private hotel.</p>

<p>Mark Akenside, the poet and physician, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> visited in this street, on
January 22, 1761&mdash;at which time he was physician to Queen Charlotte&mdash;by
Sir Joshua Reynolds. Heinrich Heine, during his stay in England, April
23 to August 8, 1827, lodged at No. 32 Craven Street. A notorious
resident of this street was James Hackman (1752-1779), incumbent of
Wiveton, Norfolk. He fell in love with Martha Ray, who was the mother
of nine children, of whom Lord Sandwich was the father. His passion was
so great that, as the lady would not marry him, he shot her dead on
the night of April 7, 1779, in the piazza of Covent Garden Theatre. He
turned the pistol upon himself, but without fatal effect. He was hanged
at Tyburn twelve days later.</p>

<p>A more interesting resident was James Smith, one of the authors of
the <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, who lived for many years at No. 27, where
he died on December 24, 1839. This remarkable literary character,
the son of a solicitor to the Ordnance, was born in 1775. At the
age of twenty-seven he had made his mark in Fleet Street, and,
from 1807 to 1817, the articles to the <i>Monthly Mirror</i> entitled
"Horace in London" were written by him. In 1812, with his younger
brother, Horatio, he published the <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, in which
Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, Lord Byron, Sir Walter Scott, and other
writers were parodied with admirable felicity. He wrote many of the
"Entertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>ments" for Charles Mathews the Elder, including <i>Country
Cousins</i> in 1820, and the <i>Trip to France</i> and the <i>Trip to America</i>
in the two succeeding years. For the last two sketches he received a
thousand pounds. "A thousand pounds!" he used to exclaim, with a shrug
of the shoulders, "and all for nonsense."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He was lucky enough to
obtain a legacy of 300 for a complimentary epigram on Mr Strachan, the
King's printer. Being patted on the head when a boy by Chief-Justice
Mansfield, in Highgate churchyard, and once seeing Horace Walpole on
his lawn at Twickenham, were the two chief historical events of Mr
Smith's quiet life. The four reasons that kept so clever a man employed
on mere amateur trifling were these&mdash;an indolent disinclination to
sustained work, a fear of failure, a dislike to risk a well-earned
fame, and a foreboding that literary success might injure his practice
as a lawyer. His favourite visits were to Lord Mulgrave's, Mr Croker's,
Lord Abinger's, Lady Blessington's, and Lord Harrington's. Pretty Lady
Blessington used to say of him, that "James Smith, if he had not been
a <i>witty</i> man, must have been a <i>great</i> man. He died in his house in
Craven Street, with the calmness of a philosopher, on the 24th of
December, 1839, in the sixty-fifth year of his age."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> It was on his
own street that he wrote the well-known epigram:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"In Craven Street, Strand, ten attorneys find place,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And ten dark coal-barges are moor'd at its base;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fly, Honesty, fly! seek some safer retreat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For there's <i>craft</i> in the river, and <i>craft</i> in the street."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>This satire led to a retort by Sir George Rose, the judge and
well-known legal writer, in extemporaneous lines written at a dinner:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"Why should Honesty fly to some safer retreat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From attorneys and barges?&mdash;'od rot 'em!&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For the lawyers are <i>just</i> at the top of the street,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the barges are <i>just</i> at the bottom."</span><br />

<p>Lawyers still have their offices in Craven Street, but the coal-barges
vanished in 1876. A few doors from James Smith's, in the house on
the left-hand side from the Strand, there lodged, in 1885, the
celebrated American comedian, John Sleeper Clarke (1834-1899). His
rooms overlooked the back of what was then the Avenue Theatre. This
house, opened on March 11, 1882, was rebuilt by Mr Cyril Maude, and, on
the eve of its re-opening, December 5, 1905, it was destroyed by the
fall of the roof of Charing Cross Station. Again rebuilt by Mr Maude,
it was opened, on January 28, 1907, as the Playhouse. The theatrical
associations of this part of London are, indeed, like Mr Weller's
knowledge of London, "extensive and peculiar."</p>

<p>We (Miss Cadogan and myself) went to Charing Cross to see the
melancholy procession. Just as we got there, we received a ticket from
the Bishop of Rochester, to admit us into the Abbey. No admittance
could be obtained but under his hand. We hurried away in a hackney
coach, dreading to be too late. The bell of St Martin's and the
Abbey gave a sound that smote upon my very soul. When we got to the
cloisters, we found multitudes striving for admittance. We gave our
ticket, and were let in, but unluckily we ought to have kept it. We
followed the man, who unlocked a door of iron, and directly closed it
upon us and two or three others, and we found ourselves in a tower,
with a dark winding staircase, consisting of half a hundred stone
steps. When we got to the top there was no way out; we ran down again,
called, and beat the door till the whole pile resounded with our cries.
Here we staid half an hour in perfect agony; we were sure it would be
all over: nay, we might never be let out; we might starve; we might
perish. At length our clamours brought an honest man&mdash;a guardian angel,
I then thought him. We implored him to take care of us, and get us into
a part of the Abbey whence we might see the grave. He asked for the
Bishop's ticket, we had given it away to the wrong person, and he was
not obliged to believe we ever had one: yet he saw so much truth in
our grief, that though we were most shabby, and a hundred fine people
were soliciting the same favour, he took us under each arm&mdash;carried
us safely through the crowd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> and put us in a little gallery directly
over the grave, where we could see and hear everything as distinctly
as if the Abbey had been a parlour. Little things sometimes affect the
mind strongly! We were no sooner recovered from the fresh burst of
grief than I cast my eyes, the first thing, on Handel's monument and
read the scroll in his hand, "I know that my Redeemer liveth." Just at
three the great doors burst open with a noise that shook the roof; the
organ struck up, and the whole choir advanced to the grave, in hoods
and surplices, singing all the way: then Sheridan, as chief mourner;
then the body (alas! whose body), with ten noblemen and gentlemen,
pall-bearers; hardly a dry eye&mdash;the very players, bred to the trade of
counterfeiting, shed genuine tears.</p>

<p>As soon as the body was let down, the bishop began the service, which
he read in a low, but solemn and devout manner. Such an awful stillness
reigned, that every word was audible. How I felt it! Judge if my heart
did not assent to the wish that the soul of our dear brother now
departed was in peace. And this is all of Garrick! Yet a very little
while, and he shall say to the worm, "Thou art my brother"; and to
corruption, "Thou art my mother and my sister." So passes away the
fashion of this world. The very night he was buried, the playhouses
were as full, and the Pantheon was as crowded, as if no such thing had
happened: nay, the very mourners of the day partook of the revelries of
the night&mdash;the same night too!</p>

<p>As soon as the crowd was dispersed, our friend came to us with an
invitation from the bishop's lady, to whom he had related our disaster,
to come into the deanery. We were carried into her dressing-room,
but being incapable of speech, she very kindly said she would not
interrupt such sorrow, and left us; but sent up wine, cakes, and all
manner of good things, which was really well-timed. I caught no cold,
notwithstanding all I went through.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><p class="ph3">FOOTNOTES:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> This was the Great Fire which destroyed nearly every
building of importance in the City, including one hundred and seven
churches and the Royal Exchange. The second Royal Exchange was opened
on September 28, 1669. The recorded visits of Pepys to the New Exchange
ended in April, 1669. Pepys was then busy with state affairs, and his
eyesight was failing. On the latter account he brought the Diary to a
close on May 31 of that year. Of course, he may have visited the New
Exchange after the last entry recorded in his Diary. Indeed, it is
probable that he did so. When we consider what enjoyment he derived
from his various meetings here, from his purchases of play-books and
silk stockings, and from his drinking of whey, the last words in his
Diary become doubly pathetic: "And thus ends all that I doubt I shall
ever be able to do with my own eyes in the keeping of my Journall, I
being not able to do it any longer, having done now so long as to undo
my eyes almost every time that I take a pen in my hand; and therefore,
whatever comes of it, I must forbear: and therefore resolve, from this
time forward, to have it kept by my people in long-hand, and must be
contented to set down no more than is fit for them and all the world to
know; or if there be anything, I must endeavour to keep a margin in my
book open, to add here and there a note in short-hand with my own hand,
and so I betake myself to that course, which is almost as much as to
see myself go into my grave: for which, and all the discomforts that
will accompany my being blind, the good God prepare me!"</p></div></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
